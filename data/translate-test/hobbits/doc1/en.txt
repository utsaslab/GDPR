Rainer Brenner from the Ciphers Ciphers said in the broadcast: &quot;The investigation was then mainly focused on the drug milieu. But currently we are looking for a serial offender. &quot;It goes to the detective about the man to&quot; demons &quot;. Brenner: &quot;It should mean that he is perhaps a normal man - a neighbor, a husband, a colleague.&quot; It is clear he must have known the street and the area around the body well, possibly drove the streets in for professional reasons the environment. The police presented two important and highly recognizable pieces of evidence: a 67-centimeter-long nylon strap with slings on both ends made by the killer for the strangling murder and a five-centimeter-wide, red roll of Leukoplast patches taped to the women&#39;s mouths. At that time, the patch was not commercially available in normal drugstores and could indicate that the killer had a medical profession.
