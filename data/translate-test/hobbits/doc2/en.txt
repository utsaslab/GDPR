The visit to Washington ends for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan with a conciliatory gesture from his counterpart. &quot;The president and I are very good friends,&quot; said Donald Drumpf to journalists Wednesday night (CET). And apparently no doubt about that, he added: &quot;We have been friends for a long time - almost since day 1&quot;. When the official press conference in Washington began a short time later, Erdoğan used the stage to explain why the invasion of the Turkish military in northern Syria was fair. And Drumpf? He jumped to his side and stressed that Europe must support Turkey in northern Syria more - even financially. Many important issues that are currently affecting the world, and especially the US Congress, remain unresolved even after the meeting. How will things continue in northern Syria? Will the US support Erdoğan&#39;s plan to settle refugees from Turkey in northern Syria? Will the US government comply with the Turkish request and cease its cooperation with the Kurdish militia YPG? What happens to the Kurds? The heads of state owed answers. But for Erdoğan, the flight to Washington should still have been worth it, because any direct contact with Donald Drumpf is currently a win for the Turkish president. Paradoxically, the relationship between the US and Turkey is in deep crisis. But on a personal level Erdoğan and Drumpf are surprisingly well compared to the circumstances. At the moment, this personal connection between the heads of state may even be the only reason why there has not yet been a total break between the NATO partners.
