(Complainant), represented by B *** & C *** Rechtsanwälte, dated 10 April 2018 against Pension N *** Ges.m.b.H. & Co KG (Respondent), represented by D *** and E *** Rechtsanwälte OG, for breach of the right to secrecy in the operation of an image processing installation as follows:  The appeal is dismissed. Legal basis: §§ 1, 24 and 69 of the Data Protection Act - DSG, BGBl. I Nr. 165/1999 idgF; Article 4 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR, OJ EPO 1. Statement of reasons A. Arguments of the parties and procedure 1. By submitting an application of 10 April 2018, the appellant submitted that the respondent was engaged in the field of multi-party co-ownership Storeroom on GST ** 43/1 and on the GST ** 51/2, which is the sole property of the complainant, a video surveillance without permission and consent. It will be monitored with several video cameras the entrance to the "chalet-dependance". As guests of the complainant would arrive there by taxi and the like and the area was not reserved for the exclusive use of the respondent, video surveillance was inadmissible. Whether the applicant had made a report to the data processing register was not known to the complainant. 2. By resolution of 13 April 2018, DS: DSB-D216.713 / 0001-DSB / 2018, the DPA requested the Respondent to comment on the allegations. 3. By submission of 26 April 2018, the Respondent commented that the camera objects mentioned by the Appellant were mounted in an underground tunnel system. The Respondent had parking spaces within this tunnel, while the complainant only had access to her garage. It is true that during the construction of the tunnel, the subject video surveillance system was installed - at that time with the consent of the then owner Mrs. Ulrike H ***, which was the legal predecessor of the complainant. The cameras have not been changed since then. Camera 1 monitors the entrance to the garage, Camera 2 the spaces of the Respondent, Camera 3 the emergency exit, Camera 4 the access from the parking spaces to the Pension of the Respondent. The cameras would therefore not capture the complainant's garage and have been affixed with the consent of the then owner. According to the legal situation at that time, no permits were required and the respondent relied on the admissibility. In any case, the real problem is that, contrary to the rules of the tunnel, the complainant makes unauthorized taxi rides and also uses the places of the respondent. This would result in significant disadvantages for the Respondent. 4. The DPA granted the complainant a hearing by order of 3 May 2018, DP: DSB-D2136.713 / 0002-DSB / 2018. 5. By submission of 16 May 2018, the complainant stated that it was right for the then owner of the video surveillance system to agree, but last winter (2016/17), cameras 2 and 3 were renewed without the complainant participate. In any case, she was not the co-owner of the video system. It could also not be inferred from the consent at the time that the complainant now agrees and also that monitoring is rightly so. Also monitor the camera 3 the only significant access to the hotel premises of the complainant. 6. By resolution of 28 May 2018, DS: DSB-D216.713 / 0003-DSB / 2018, the DPA informed that the General Data Protection Regulation had entered into force on 25 May 2018 and that the complainant had specified it further Deficiencies, which only arose after the entry into force of § 24 DSG without a transitional period, may be remedied. At the same DC, the Respondent was requested to disclose whether the recordings were stored and how the camera systems were labeled in order to ascertain the facts of the case. 7. By submission of 31 May 2018, the complainant sent a letter which appeared to have been produced in correspondence between the legal representatives of the parties now accused before lodging the complaint. It states that video surveillance is also in the appellant's sense that the video surveillance had already existed since 1997/98 and that it was requested to concretize a situation. Also included was the need to improve the defects to be corrected in accordance with § 24. It was stated that the complainant continued to be violated in her fundamental right to privacy and that the infringement would be independent of storage. Furthermore, she and her guests are exposed to constant monitoring pressure and cause this in any case a violation of protected by § 16 ABGB fundamental rights goods. In addition, the storage, evaluation and further processing of footage would constitute a violation of the fundamental rights of the Respondent and its guests. It would also result from the administrative criminal proceedings of BH Bludenz for BHBL-II-4 *** - 2013/0 * 67- * 5 and a picture presented there that the Respondent not only supervises their parking spaces, but the entrance to the complainant's hotel , The Respondent rejected the dismantling of the cameras. Also, the Respondent did not consider whether data would be stored and if so, how long. 8. The Respondent commented on 15 June 2018 and stated that the recordings would be stored on a password-protected PC in a separately locked room for 72 hours, that the data processing as a former standard application would continue to be justified and the signs "Attention video surveillance Pension N *** Ges.mbH & Co KG "were mounted. B. Object of the complaint On the basis of the submission of the parties, the subject-matter of the proceedings is the question of whether the complainant is infringed by the data-processing facility of the Respondent in its right to confidentiality of personal data. C. Determination of facts On the basis of the arguments of the parties, the following is stated: The Respondent, with the consent of the then owner, Ms. Ulrike H ***, at the time of the construction of the underground access tunnel in 1997/98, which the complainant legally complied with as a vehicle license. Pitch is used in I *** berg a video surveillance with four cameras installed. Camera 1 monitors the entrance to the garage, Camera 2 the spaces of the Respondent, Camera 3 the emergency exit, Camera 4 the access from the parking spaces to the Pension of the Respondent. An area of ​​access to the complainant and the emergency exit are also included due to the unity of the room. For the purpose of property protection and preservation of evidence, the camera recordings are stored for 72 hours. The recordings are stored on a password-protected PC in a separately locked room. The signs "Attention Video Surveillance Pension N *** Ges.m.b.H. & Co KG "were added during the procedure before the Data Protection Authority. The cameras exist since the construction of the tunnel and have been renewed a camera in the winter of 2016/17. Proof of evidence: Evidence was provided by the comments and evidence provided by the professional party representatives of the litigants. The conflicting claims result from differing views on the lawfulness of data processing. It is not disputed that the recorded area of ​​the image processing plant in the tunnel is used to monitor the spaces of the Respondent. The evidence taken of the retention period results from the respondent's arguments, the accuracy of which is not doubted by the DPA. D. From a legal point of view it follows: The admissibility and timeliness of the complaint: On 25 May 2018, the DSGVO and the DSG entered into force. The complaint, initially conducted as a control and ombuds procedure pursuant to Section 30 DSG 2000, was to be continued as a complaint procedure pursuant to Section 24 DSG due to the transitional provisions (Section 69 (4) DSG). The complainant is a legal entity with seat in Austria and subsumes the complaint under the basic right to data protection standardized in § 1 DSG, which was not changed by the DSG. Although the GDPR itself protects only natural persons, however, it must be assumed in a constitutionally compliant interpretation that the rights standardized in § 1 DSG are also assigned to legal persons and that they can therefore rely on them. Pursuant to Section 24 (4) of the DSG, the claim for the treatment of a complaint lapses if the participant fails to bring it within one year after having become aware of the complaining event, but at the latest within three years after the event has allegedly taken place. As has been stated, the video surveillance in question has existed since 1997/98, and has been around for about 20 years. Nevertheless, the claim to the handling of the complaint is not statute-barred, since the statute of limitations always starts to run anew with continuous data collection (see in addition the communication of the data protection commission from 24 July 2009, GZ K121.512 / 0012-DSK / 2009). The complaint is therefore to be dealt with in substance. The content of the complaint: The complaint nevertheless proves to be inadmissible. The applicability of the DSGVO or the DSG requires that data is actually processed (Art. 4 no. 2 DSGVO). It is undisputed that with the subject video surveillance data of natural persons are processed. However, as the complainant is a legal person, it can be harmed by the video surveillance as far as possible in the right to secrecy under § 1 DSG, because no data of the complainant are processed. Data of natural persons, which may be attributed to the complainant (such as staff or (co-) owners) in this context can not be ipso facto considered to be data of the complainant, as the rights under the DSGVO and the DSG are personal rights, which are characterized in that their content is determined by the person of the claimant, so that by a change of his person and the performance itself undergoes a change (see also the finding of the Federal Administrative Court of 24 November 2014, GZ W214 2008246-1, mwN). Nor does the complainant allege that it alleges the alleged infringement on behalf of and with the power of attorney of any natural persons concerned. In that regard, § 1 DSG fundamentally differs from § 16 ABGB; The latter provision may, according to the established case law of the Supreme Court, also be used to counteract possible surveillance by camera dummies or the like. proceed. In this case, the Supreme Court also affirms the legal right of a legal person to defend itself against (inadmissible) monitoring pressure (see the resolution of 29 March 2017, GC 6 Ob 231 / 16p, no further details). However, since - as stated above - the applicability of data protection provisions requires actual data processing - and not just a possible monitoring pressure - this case law of the OGH on § 16 ABGB is not transferable to § 1 DSG. The appeal was therefore dismissed in accordance with the claim.
