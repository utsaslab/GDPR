According to case-law of the Data Protection Authority, a data subject can still rely on any provision of the GDPR, as far as this can result in a possible violation of the right to secrecy under § 1 (1) DSG (see DSB of 13 September 2018 , DSB-D123.070 / 0005-DSB / 2018, according to which a breach by the controller of Article 32 may result in a violation of § 1 (1) DSG). GZ: DSB-D123.076 / 0003-DSB / 2018 dated 31.10.2018 [Note: Editors: names and companies, legal forms and product names, addresses (including URLs, IP and e-mail addresses), file numbers (and the like) , etc., as well as their initials and abbreviations can be abbreviated and / or changed for reasons of pseudonymisation. Legal basis: §§ 1 (1) and (2), 24 (1) and (5) of the Data Protection Act (DSG), BGBl. The fact that Article 14 does not appear to be mentioned in Article 12 (2) GDPR can only be understood as meaning that the person responsible - unlike the right to information or cancellation - does not act at the request of a data subject (see Article 12 (3) which states that 'information must be provided on the measures taken pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 without delay'), but that the information obligation of the person responsible must be fulfilled irrespective of the request.
