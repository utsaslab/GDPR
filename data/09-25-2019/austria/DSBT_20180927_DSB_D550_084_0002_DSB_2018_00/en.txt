The following facts are relevant to the decision: I.1. Mr Istvan O ***, A - **** **** city, J *** gasse * 8 / * 2, is the holder of registration of the Audi motor vehicle with the official Hungarian registration R *** 2 * 4. I.2. At least since the 09.05.2018 (10:45 clock) two video cameras (Dash Cams) are installed in the interior of the subject vehicle. The two video surveillance systems, which are installed on the front or rear windows, are triggered by a motion sensor in the event of perceived movements and image recordings are saved on an SD memory card. In any case, the detection range of the two cameras covers public traffic in front of and behind the vehicle. I.3. Mr. Istvan O *** has removed one of the procedural video cameras (Dash-Cams) on 20.08.2018 from his vehicle; the rear-mounted camera was not taken out of service until this penalty was given. I.4. The picture taken by the two video cameras (Dash-Cams) within the subject motor vehicle is not suitably marked. I.5. The accused is a Hungarian citizen, married and has three (non-minor) children, one of whom is physically disabled and has a duty of custody; the accused undertakes a minor job and derives a monthly net income of € 900,00. In addition, the defendant has no income or assets, there is a tax arrears at the tax office of approximately € 1,300.00. [Proof: Advertisement of the LPD Vienna **, SPK ****, ** - PI U *** street to GZ .: PAD / * 3 / * 9 * 23 * 5 / 001A / StV from 09.05.2018, transcript on the hearing of the defendant by the Data Protection Authority dated 27.08.2018 and inspection of the act] II. The findings are based on the following evidence: II.1. The data protection authority submits the content of the advertisement in the act by the LPD Vienna **, SPK **** (GZ. PAD / * 3 / * 9 * 23 * 5 / 001A / StV) from 09.05.2018 as well as the content of the The hearing of the accused on 27.08.2018, from which the statements of the defendant to its justification, their findings of fact. II.2. When presenting the facts relevant to the decision, reference was made in each case to the specific evidence in the act. The findings regarding the use and functioning of the two installed in the vehicle of the accused Dash-Cam based on the reproduced in the display of the LPD Vienna perceptions and incidents on the occasion of a road police check from 09.05.2018, 10:45 clock in Vienna * *, K **** lane opposite the ONr 3 *. Literally, the following - relevant to the present case - perceptions of the police officers in the context of their display as follows: "[...] Furthermore, it should be noted that Mr. O *** installed in the middle of the windshield, inside the vehicle a camera (Dashcam) which immediately started to record as soon as something moved in front of the camera or triggered the sensor. The record will be stored on a SD card according to Mr. O ***. Another camera, which also recorded the traffic was located in the left rear of the rear window, also in the interior of the vehicle. When asked why he has cameras in the car and records and stores the traffic, he states that he needs it and can use it as proof in case of an accident. Mr. O *** walked in front of the vehicle and ML could see the sensor trigger and the camera started to record. [...] "According to the accused on the occasion of the police control itself stated that the image data generated by the two Dash-Cams are stored on SD memory cards, asked for the purpose of the image, the accused stated that they need in case of an accident. There is no doubt as to the veracity of the content of the report - especially in the light of the duty of disciplinary and disciplinary action of police officers. II.3. On the other hand, the statements made by the data protection authority on 27.08.2018 in the context of the interrogation of the accused, according to which the two dash-cams he used were never operated in conjunction with a memory card and therefore never existed as a means of image capture, contradict the On the occasion of the police check on 09.05.2018 the accused himself made statements to the police officers and the findings made by them. Regarding his statement in the context of the interrogation, according to which the Dash-Cam originally mounted on the windshield of his vehicle about a week before his hearing by the Data Protection Authority - ie on 20.08.2018 - broke off from the holder and therefore from the meantime In case of doubt, the data protection authority assumes that the creditor is credible. However, for his argument that the two cameras were never operated in conjunction with a storage medium and therefore at no time was an image capture was possible or that the camera on the rear window is merely used as a parking aid, the accused could provide any evidence and not convincing them otherwise. Overall, the responsibility of the accused therefore represented contradictory and lifelong over large parts and was therefore to qualify as untrustworthy protection claim. II.4. Consequently, the data protection authority comes to the conclusion on the basis of the general life experience that the two procedural Dash Cams until 20/08/2018 - the rear dash cam also beyond - the traffic in front of and behind the vehicle recorded and the image data on a storage medium were recorded. Ultimately, the operation of two dash-cams without any storage option would have no practical benefit, the latter is regularly in capturing and storing image data for evidence in the event of an accident or the like. to be seen. II.5. The defendant's statements regarding his financial circumstances and custodial duties are considered credible. III. Legally, it follows: On administrative criminal liability: III.1. As to the legal situation: Pursuant to section 62 (1) (4) DSG, a fine of up to EUR 50,000 is imposed on anyone who operates image processing contrary to the provisions of section 3 of the main section (sections 12 and 13 DSG). Art. 83 para. 5 lit. a GDPR specifies that, in case of infringement of the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 GDPR, fines of up to EUR 20 000 000 or, in the case of a company, up to 4% of its total worldwide annual turnover in the previous financial year may be imposed which of the amounts is higher. Pursuant to Section 69 (5) of the DSG, violations of the DSG 2000 which were not yet pending at the time of the entry into force of the DSG must be assessed in accordance with the legal position following the entry into force of the DSG. A criminal offense, which was realized before the entry into force of the DSG, is to be judged according to the legal position, which is more favorable for the offender in its overall effect; this also applies to the appeal procedure. Since the beginning of the objective conduct before 25 May 2018 - the date of entry into force of the DSG - is the highest possible punishment under § 62 Abs. 1 Z 4 DSG over that according to § 52 paragraph 2 DSG 2000, come in terms of the penalty - so far it violates the DSG 2000 and / or the DSG concerns - the regulations of the DSG 2000 for the application. Re. Point 1: III.2. In the present case, the operation of the image recording by dash-cams, based on the subject vehicle of the accused, undisputed image capture in the sense of § 12 para. 1 DSG before. By raising and storing the image data, the material scope of Art. 2 GDPR opens up. In any case, the recorded image data represent personal data within the meaning of Art. 4 no. 1 DSGVO and, due to the collection and storage of the same, in any case also a processing within the meaning of Art. 4 no. 2 DSGVO. The accused is to be qualified as responsible for the present data processing within the meaning of Art 4 Z 7 DSGVO. III.3. Art. 5 DSGVO sets out the principles for the processing of personal data and determines its paragraph 1 lit. a that personal data must be lawfully processed, in good faith and in a manner that is reasonable for the data subject ("lawfulness, fairness, transparency"); lit. c leg. cit. lays down as a further principle that any processing must be proportionate, proportionate and limited to what is necessary for the purposes of processing ('data minimization'). Pursuant to Article 6 GDPR, processing is only lawful if at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: (a) the data subject has consented to the processing of personal data concerning him for one or more specific purposes; (b) the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or for the performance of any pre-contractual action taken at the request of the data subject; (c) the processing is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; (d) the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or any other natural person; (e) the processing is necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest or in the exercise of public authority delegated to the controller. (f) the processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject requiring the protection of personal data prevail, in particular where the data subject is a Child acts. As regards the lawfulness of processing operations, recital 47 explains, inter alia, that it may be justified by the legitimate interests of a controller, including a controller to whom the personal data may be disclosed or a third party, provided that the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are concerned Person does not outweigh; In doing so, account must be taken of the reasonable expectations of the person concerned based on his relationship with the person responsible. For example, there could be a legitimate interest if there is a relevant and proportionate relationship between the data subject and the controller, eg. For example, if the data subject is a customer of the person responsible or in his services. In any case, the existence of a legitimate interest should be assessed with particular care, and it must also be considered whether, at the time of the personal data collection and in the circumstances in which it occurs, a data subject may reasonably foresee that there may be processing for that person Purpose will be done. In particular, where personal data are processed in situations where an affected person does not reasonably have to expect further processing, the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject may outweigh the interests of the controller. III.4. The scope of the subject Dash-Cams will - as in point I.2. detected - the public road traffic in front of and behind the motor vehicle. The recording of image data is triggered by a motion sensor and image data is stored on storage media (SD memory cards). In this regard, it should be noted in principle that dash-cams were already inadmissible under the old legal position on the DSG 2000 (see findings of the Administrative Court of 12 September 2016, Zl. Ro 2015/04/0011); In this case, the VwGH came to the conclusion that the registration of a data application in the form of a permanent storage of image data by a vehicle-mounted video camera was to be rejected, the operation of the subject Dash cam would have been unlawful. III.5. Section 1 (2) of the DSG (Fundamental Right to Data Protection) remains in force unchanged. According to Art. 5 para. 1 lit. c DSGVO also provide for the principles of the GDPR, that personal data must be appropriate and substantial for the purpose as well as limited to the extent necessary for the purpose of processing ("data minimization"). According to this provision, a check must be made to determine whether it is limited to what is necessary for the purposes of the processing. III.6. According to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO, processing is lawful if it is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, unless the interests or fundamental freedoms of the data subject requiring personal data protection prevail, in particular if: the person concerned is a child. As a result, in relation to the present case, this means that, in particular, when personal data are processed in situations in which an affected person does not reasonably have to expect further processing, the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject may outweigh the interests of the controller. In that respect, the assessment of the question of the lawfulness of the processing within the meaning of Article 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO a proportionality test. However, road users do not reasonably have to expect that their personal data, and this undoubtedly includes those associated with the processing in question, will be processed in this way. It can not be said that storage of image data using video cameras installed in a car nowadays is common practice in road traffic (see also the warning of the Data Protection Authority dated 09.07.2018, GZ DSB-D485.000 / 0001-DSB / 2018). III.7. Since the road users detected by the receiving area of ​​the subject dash-cams do not have to reasonably expect to be taken up, especially when there is no accident, the operation of the image recording violates the principles standardized in Article 5. A legal basis for the legitimacy of this type of data processing within the meaning of Article 6 (1) of the GDPR is not apparent and has not been put forward by the defendant. In summary, the data protection authority does not recognize a legitimate interest in the operation of the image acquisition on the part of the person responsible, in particular with regard to the possibility of triggering image recordings by movements perceived by movement sensors, independently of any accident occurrence. Rather, in the present case, the constitutionally protected right to secrecy within the meaning of § 1 DSG of the registered road users outweighs a possible interest in the operation of the subject image capture. Re. Point 2: III.8. Pursuant to Section 13 (5) DSG, the person in charge of taking pictures must identify them appropriately. In any case, the person responsible must clearly state from the marking, unless he is already familiar with the persons concerned according to the circumstances of the case. The marking must be made locally in such a way that any potentially affected person approaching a monitored object has the possibility of avoiding video surveillance as far as possible. A similar arrangement was provided for by Section 50d (1) DSG 2000. This is not the case in the present case, since no mark has been attached to the motor vehicle, which indicates the outgoing image of the vehicle interior. Consequently, the non-fulfillment of this obligation in the present case violates § 13 (3) in conjunction with § 62 (1) 4 DSG and for the period before 25 May 2018 § 52 (2) 4 in conjunction with § 50d DSG 2000 DSG 2000 III.9. Applying the requirements and obligations of Articles 5 and 6 DSGVO and § 13 DSG on the facts of the case, the cognizant authority comes to the conclusion that the person in charge should not have operated the subject-specific image recording. III.10. In the light of the facts established as proven, the accused as controller has, under Article 4 (7) DSGVO, the objective facts of the administrative offense of Art. 83 (5) lit. a DSGVO and § 62 para. 1 no. 4 DSG and § 52 para. 2 no. 4 DSG 2000, respectively. III.11. In the case of administrative offenses whose image is a mere violation of a prohibition or noncompliance with a law and which does not provide for damage or danger (disobedience), if the offender is within the meaning of § 5 Paragraph 1 VStG does not make it credible that he is not at fault for the violation of the administrative provision (see VwGH of 13.12.2016, Ra 2016/09/0099). There is a presumption of culpability from the outset (eg VwGH, 26.06.2018, Ra 2016/05/0005). It is up to the accused to make it clear that he was unable to comply with the administrative provisions without his fault. In order to substantiate lack of fault, it must be stated that the accused has taken measures which, under the foreseeable circumstances, could reasonably be expected to comply with the statutory provisions. III.12. The accused did not argue that compliance with the provisions of Art. 5 (1) lit. a and c and Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO and the 13 para. 5 DSG and § 50d para. 1 DSG 2000 would not have been possible. As regards items 3 and 4: III.13. Since in the course of the preliminary investigation the fulfillment of the objective facts of the breach of the logging and deletion obligations could not be established with the security required for a criminal proceeding, the procedure in this regard was according to § 45 Abs. 1 Z 1 (1st case) VStG - im Doubt for the accused - to stop. IV. For sentencing it must be stated: IV.1. According to § 19 Abs. 1 VStG the bases for the assessment of the punishment are the meaning of the criminally protected right property and the intensity of its impairment by the act. Moreover, according to the purpose of the threat of punishment, the relevant grounds for aggravation and mitigation, if they do not already determine the threat of punishment, must be weighed up against each other. Particular attention should be paid to the extent of the fault. Taking into account the peculiar nature of the administrative criminal law, §§ 32 to 35 of the Criminal Code apply mutatis mutandis. The income and financial circumstances and any liability of the accused person must be taken into account when calculating fines. In the area of ​​application of the General Data Protection Regulation - DSGVO, all circumstances of Art. 83 (2) GDPR must be taken into account in the sentencing. In the present case, the accused's low incomes of € 900,00 per month and his or her caring responsibilities for a child with physical limitations in sentencing were taken into account. IV.2. The provisions of §§ 12f DSG and Art. 5 and 6 DSGVO are intended to protect the fundamental rights protected legal positions of those affected from intervening in public or non-public space for private purposes used image recordings that do not meet the requirements with regard to their admissibility and proportionality , The duties imposed on the person responsible for image acquisition in § 13 DSG should, on the one hand, enable the data protection authority to monitor compliance with legal requirements in the case of image processing and, on the other hand, make it easier for those affected to assert their rights or, if possible, (unwanted) image acquisition dodge. IV.3. In the specific case, when determining the penalty it had to be taken into account that the inadmissible operation of the image acquisition was potentially suitable, a large number of affected persons, in this case accidentally entering the coverage of the subject Dash-Cams, in their rights protected by copyright especially in their right to secrecy within the meaning of § 1 DSG. IV.4. The alleged infringement is considered to be difficult because of the high level of illegality and the fact that it is a systematic violation of the obligation of the person responsible. Finally, the image recording in the present case is triggered by motion sensors and is thus continuously an unlimited number of - naturally located in motion - road users recorded. As stated, image data can also be recorded systematically independently of the occurrence of an accident. IV.5. This was therefore considered to be aggravating, with the intensity of the interference resulting from the operation of unacceptable and unrelated image processing, which in this case covers an unrestricted number of public road users, in the present case related to sentence 1 - in relation to Spruchpunkt 2 - has depressed accordingly. A waiver of the imposition is therefore out of the question. The duration of the infringement - the image capture is as stated for at least several months in operation - is also considered to be aggravating. IV.6. In any case, as regards the degree of fault or the extent of the fault of the accused responsible, it was assumed that the behavior was negligent. Negligent behavior is neither mitigated nor taken into account. IV.7. Therefore, and to prevent the accused from further criminal acts of the same kind, the imposition of a penalty in the specific case was required. The need for special prevention also results from the fact that the image recording - at least by one of the two dash cams - in the vehicle of the accused continues to operate. IV.8. In the present case, it was considered mitigating that the defendant was debt-aware, participated in the proceedings and thereby contributed to the truth; In addition, no relevant criminal record is recorded against him by the DPA. IV.8. The penalty actually imposed therefore appears, taking into account the financial circumstances disclosed by the accused, with regard to the actual value of the crime, up to € 10,000 (section 52 (2) no. 4 DSG 2000 in conjunction with section 69 (5) of the DSG). and / or € 20,000,000 (Art. 83 (5) GDPR), which are proportionate to the facts and require their imposition in order to deter the accused and third parties from committing similar or similar criminal acts.
