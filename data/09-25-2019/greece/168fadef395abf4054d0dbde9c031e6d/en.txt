                                                     Athens, 31 January 2019
                                                         Ref.: Gen./Εxt./768

                                PRESS RELEASE

                        Initial conclusions from the
          Hellenic DPA’s “ex officio” GDPR compliance investigation

   The Hellenic DPA, in order to a) explore the level of compliance with the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) -six months after its  entry  into
force- and the specific legislation on e-privacy, b) raise the awareness  of
data controllers and data subjects,  and  also  c)  exercise  its  envisaged
powers, has carried out the following “ex officio” investigation, which  was
initiated in December 2018 and is ongoing:


   More particularly, the Hellenic DPA carried out an  investigation  to  65
controllers operating online in the fields of financial services,  insurance
services, e-commerce,  ticket  services  and  public  sector  services,  for
exploring  the  way  specific  requirements  are  met  in   the   areas   of
transparency, the use of cookies, the sending of  online  messages  and  the
security of  websites  through  indicative  checkpoints,  perceived  to  the
citizen in their navigation and the use of internet services.


1. The initial conclusions that were drawn as a result  of  this  initiative
   highlight, in general, the lack of compliance  with  the  legislation  on
   cookies and relevant technologies in almost all the controllers.
2. There was also a lack of information on  the  processing  operations  and
   the recipients of the data at around 40% of the controllers. It is  worth
   noting that the public sector lags  behind  in  compliance,  mainly  with
   regard to transparency, in almost all  of  the  organizations  that  were
   investigated.
3. On the  contrary,  at  a  high  percentage  of  more  than  80%  of  data
   controllers, a satisfactory level of security was observed.
4. Furthermore, a sufficient degree,  more  than  70%,  of  Data  Protection
   Officers’ designation was noted in the private sector.


   On  the  basis  of  the  final  conclusions  of  this  first  large-scale
investigation to check  compliance,  after  the  entry  into  force  of  the
Regulation, the DPA will exercise its  powers  that  are  envisaged  by  the
pertinent provisions.

The investigation was presented in the Authority’s  recent  Information  Day
on the occasion of the 13th European Data Protection  Day  on  January  28th
and       is       available       in       Greek       at        www.dpa.gr
