The Commissioner has today issued his decision to the Lands
Authority after concluding the investigation of the data breach, that was
brought to his attention by the Times of Malta on 23rd November
2018.  The findings of the investigation established that the online
application platform available on the Authority’s portal lacked the necessary
technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of
processing.  The Lands Authority was found to have infringed the provisions
of Article 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and, in terms of
Article 21 of the Data Protection Act (CAP. 586), was served with an
administrative fine of €5,000. The level of the fine was reached after the
Commissioner took into account the circumstances set out under Article 83.2 of
the GDPR. 
The temporary ban imposed on the Authority’s portal has been
lifted.
The Lands Authority offered their full and unrestricted
collaboration to the Commissioner during the course of the entire investigation.
