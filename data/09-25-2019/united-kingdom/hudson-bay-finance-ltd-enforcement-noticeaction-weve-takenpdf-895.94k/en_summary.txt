‘the prescribed period’ means forty days or such other

period as may be prescribed;

‘the relevant day’, in relation to a request under this
section, means the day on which the data controller
receives the request or, if later, the first day on which
the data controller has both the required fee and the

information referred to in subsection (3).”

14. The Commissioner is of the view that the data controller has
contravened the sixth data principle in that, contrary to section 7, it
has failed to inform the complainant, without undue delay, whether
their personal data is being processed by or on behalf of the data
controller and, where this is the case, failed, without undue delay,
to have communicated to them in an intelligible form such

information as may constitute personal data. For information on how we process
