In preparation for the upcoming elections to the European Parliament, the Ministry of Public Administration, in charge of the Election and Referendum Campaign Act, has issued a Guide for Electoral Campaign Organizers. The preparation of professional materials involved individual bodies, including the Information Commissioner, who provided an introductory address and a special chapter on rules and traps in the processing of personal data in election campaigns. This is an important aspect of election activities and political campaigns, as respecting data protection rules is crucial to protecting democracy. At the same time, it is also a means of maintaining citizens&#39; confidence and the integrity of elections. The guide will be a welcome tool for election campaign organizers and other participants, explaining, among other things, key factors that organizers need to take into account to ensure that personal information is lawfully, fairly and securely processed. A guide for election campaign organizers is available at this link.
