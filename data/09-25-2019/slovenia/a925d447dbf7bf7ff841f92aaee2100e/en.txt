The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) contains a new concept for joint controllers - two or more controllers who jointly determine the purposes and methods of processing. In general, common managers appear especially in cases of joint collection and use of personal data, such as joint campaigns, sweepstakes, promotional activities, competitions, joint video surveillance of entry into multi-owner and tenant business premises, shared information bases and online platforms. In such cases, the General Regulation requires a mutual agreement to be laid down, specifying the responsibilities of each operator, in particular with regard to the exercise of the rights of the individual. The individual must be informed to whom everything entrusts personal data, what personal information and for what purposes and what his rights are.
