The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) adopted its guidelines on video surveillance at its 12th session, 9-10 July 2019. The guidelines clarify the application of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in connection with the processing of personal data in the implementation of video surveillance with a view to the uniform application of the General Regulation. They relate to both classic video surveillance and smart video devices, specifically explaining the rules regarding the processing of specific types of personal information, including legal bases, the use of the private use exception, and the transmission of recordings to third parties. The guidelines will be publicly discussed. They are available on the EDPB website: https: //edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/general-guidance/gdpr-guidelines-recommendations-best-practices_en
