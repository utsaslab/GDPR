On 25 May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which represents the largest reform of personal data protection in the last twenty years, has come into force. The general regulation will be in force for a year and we are preparing a cross-section of our work and the situation in the field of personal data protection in all EU Member States. How have companies and institutions implemented the General Regulation? What has the General Regulation brought to individuals? What activities did the Information Commissioner carry out in the area of control, compliance and prevention and international cooperation in the one year of application of the General Regulation and what are its findings? What are the challenges ahead? For the first year of application of the General Regulation, a press conference will be held at the Information Commissioner&#39;s premises (Vienna 22, Slovenijales Building, 10th floor) on Friday, May 24, 2019, at which we will answer the above questions.
