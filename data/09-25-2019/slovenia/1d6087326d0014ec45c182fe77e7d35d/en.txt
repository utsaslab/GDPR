The heads of the independent data protection supervisory authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Croatia, Kosovo, Northern Macedonia, Slovenia and Serbia met at the third session of the Initiative 20i7 initiative, which took place in Budva from 26 to 28 May . The meeting presented the state of compliance of national legislation with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Members of the initiative note that although they are in different stages of implementation of European data protection rules, they face similar problems. With the exception of Croatia and Kosovo, other Member States of the initiative have not yet adopted regulations implementing the European legal framework (General Regulation and the Police Directive), so the heads of independent personal data protection authorities are united in their efforts to ensure that national laws are adopted as soon as possible. Although only two Member States of the initiative are EU Member States, for all countries in the region, harmonized legislation is of particular importance for economic development, the legal certainty of data controllers and the protection of individual rights and freedoms. As one of the key users of this legislation, all supervisory authorities are reminded that the laws must be clear (lex certa), effective and in line with the General Regulation and modernized Council of Europe Convention 108+. Laws must not reduce the attained level of protection of individuals, but precisely defined procedures for the protection and enforcement of their rights are particularly important.
