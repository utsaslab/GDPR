The widespread use of online storage, advertising, analytics and other forms of processing of personal data often requires the transfer of personal data to third countries, which the average web user is often not even aware of. The rules for the protection of personal data for such transfers require a specific legal basis that offers assurance to individuals that their right to the protection of personal data will be respected wherever their data is processed. In order to understand in an understandable way the conditions required by the General Data Protection Regulation for the legitimate transfer of personal data to third countries, the Information Commissioner has created an infographic - Transfer of personal data under the Regulation to a third country / international organization in two steps. In it, the Commissioner wishes to clearly and transparently present the conditions under which personal data can be lawfully transferred to a third country or an international organization. For more information regarding transfers, see the Information Commissioner&#39;s updated guidelines: Guidelines on the transfer of personal data to third countries and international organizations under the General Data Protection Regulation.
