The Court of Justice of the European Union (hereinafter: the ECJ), in its judgment no. C-673/17 of 1 October 2019 made it clear that legitimate tracking of cookies on websites requires the active consent of the individual. The dispute involved the organization of a prize game on a website by Planet49. In order to participate in the game, Internet users have to provide their name and address where the checkboxes were located. The cookie permission box was pre-selected. The German Federal Association of Consumer Protection Organizations has questioned the lawfulness of obtaining user consent via a pre-ticked checkbox and the extent of the notification obligation imposed on the service provider before the German Supreme Court. In its judgment, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled on three important points.
