The Information Commissioner completed the guidelines on impact assessments. The well-received guidelines provide a description of Impact Assessments on (Personal) Data Protection (DPIA) as a tool for timely identification and management of risks related to personal data. The guidelines explain the legal provisions and provide answers to who, when, why and how to implement the DPIA. Based on the responses of the operators, an element was added to the risk analysis section after the measures taken, since it is advisable to assess the level of risk both before and after the actions. We also added to the guidelines a List of acts of processing of personal data subject to the requirement to carry out an impact assessment concerning the protection of personal data under Article 35, paragraph 4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 for cross-border processing cases (Annex 4), in addition to the already published of the list relating to national processing (Annex 3). The list has been approved by the European Data Protection Board and is provided in the English and Slovenian versions of the guidelines. The guidelines are available at the following link: https://www.ip-rs.si/publications/guides-and-directions/accounts-effects-of-data protection/ Mojca Prelesnik, BSc, Information Commissioner
