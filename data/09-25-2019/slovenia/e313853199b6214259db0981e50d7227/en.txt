The new infographic on the retention deadlines for non-selected candidates briefly and transparently clarifies the criteria that employers must follow when determining retention periods in the recruitment process of obtained or produced documents. In practice, IP detects the problems of many employers who do not know how to define the retention deadlines for non-selected job applicants. Due to the many different areas and forms of employment, it is not possible to set a universal rule on retention periods, so infographics will assist employers in setting internal rules tailored to their work processes. Retention periods must be determined by the employers themselves, taking into account the principle of limiting the storage of personal data, specific sectoral rules arising from the employer&#39;s legal or contractual obligations and any legal action that may be taken in connection with employment.
