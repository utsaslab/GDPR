On 24 May, the European Commission adopted European regulations for drones, and on 11 June the Implementing Regulation EC 2019/947 was also published in the Official Journal of the EU. The new rules, which enter into force on 1 July 2020, set technical requirements for unmanned aerial vehicles to improve safety, and the uniform provisions also strike a balance between the requirements of drones manufacturers and operators in terms of respect for privacy, the environment, noise protection and reliability. The new rules will replace national rules in individual EU Member States. From 1 July 2020, operators of drones, both for commercial and private use, will have to register with national authorities (Slovenia is the Civil Aviation Agency), which envisages the establishment of a drones register and a register of operators, and the competent authorities of the Member States they are obliged to give each other access to the register. The regulation also requires the creation of so-called geographical areas in which drones will be banned or restricted. The commission believes the new rules will eliminate some of the security risks associated with drones, as mandatory operator registration, the possibility of direct remote identification and the designation of geographical areas allow national authorities to better prevent abuses or illegal activities by drones.
