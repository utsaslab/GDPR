On 24 September 2019, the Court of Justice of the European Union (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the European Court of Auditors&quot;), in the case of the French Data Protection Supervisor (hereinafter: CNIL) v. Google LLC, decided that the search engine did not need to exercise the right to be forgotten. the right to delete personal data outside the European Union (EU). In other words, Google must remove hits in its search engine (only) from the search engine versions of the EU Member States in order to comply with the deletion request. In its decision in 2015, CNIL called on Google to remove links to web pages on all domain extensions of the search engine from the hit list that appears after a search by the name of a specific person. Google then, using the geoblocking technique of hits based on the IP addresses of individuals, ensured that those hits were not accessible to EU individuals but were still available outside the EU. According to CNIL, the measure was inappropriate and therefore imposed a fine of EUR 100,000 on Google. The case was then moved to court, in the form of a preliminary ruling, before the ECJ. The French court asked the SEU whether the search engine manager should remove links on all variants of his search engine, if he would grant the request for removal of links, or by removing them only from the versions or. domains corresponding to one or all Member States. The SEU has ruled that currently a search engine operator who accepts a request for removal of links by a data subject has no obligation under EU law to remove links on all versions of his search engine. However, the law requires the search engine manager to remove links on search engine variants appropriate to the Member States. In doing so, it is obliged to take sufficiently effective measures to ensure the effective protection of the fundamental rights of the individual.
