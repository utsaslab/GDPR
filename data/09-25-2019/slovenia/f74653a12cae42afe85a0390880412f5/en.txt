On 27 July 2019, the Court of Justice of the European Union (hereinafter referred to as the Court of Justice) decided in the case of Fashion ID: The case involved the insertion of a German fashion ID company, which deals with the online sale of fashion clothing, on its website Facebook Like Button. Like (a social plugin). Such an insertion results in the visitor&#39;s personal information being sent to Facebook Ireland when he or she visits a site using the Like button. This intervention is done without the aforementioned visitor being aware of it, regardless of whether it is a member of the Facebook social network and has clicked on the Facebook Like button. The Court found that by inserting such a social plug-in on its website, Fashion ID had a decisive influence on the collection and disclosure of personal information of visitors to that website in favor of Facebook Ireland, which would not have occurred if Fashion ID had not inserted that plug-in . This means that the two companies are joint controllers in this part, even if the site operator does not have access to the personal data transmitted to Facebook in the specific case. For Fashion ID (and other site managers with the Like button), this means that they have certain responsibilities as a shared manager. Before using the social plugin, it must provide a proper legal basis for the processing of personal data (eg consent) and provide the website visitor with information related to the processing. These obligations only relate to the processing operations for which Fashion ID has actually determined the purposes and means of processing.
