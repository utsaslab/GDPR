The Information Commissioner has prepared a new infographic on contract processing. It explains in a simple and understandable way who is the controller and who is the processor, ie the outsourcer of the processing of personal data (eg the accounting service that performs payroll accounting for the controller) and the key rules for such processing. The infographics also provide links to more detailed information, in particular to the Information Commissioner&#39;s guidance, which describes in more detail the duties laid down for such a relationship by Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation. https://www.ip-rs.si/publications/guides-and-guidelines/guidelines-o-contracting-processing/ A sample contract for outsourcing is also being prepared, which will be available when approved by the European Commission. of the Data Protection Board.
