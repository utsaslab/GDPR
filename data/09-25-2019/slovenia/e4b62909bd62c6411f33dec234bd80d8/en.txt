At its plenary session on 4 June, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) adopted guidelines for the preparation of codes of conduct under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The codes of conduct are intended to contribute to the proper application of the General Regulation, taking into account the specific characteristics of the different processing sectors and the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. Associations and other bodies representing types of operators or processors may draw up codes of conduct or amend or extend such codes in order to give a more detailed explanation of the application of the General Regulation, e.g. concerning uniform procedures for informing the individual, ensuring security and other duties under the General Regulation. The guidelines will help different chambers and associations that wish to harmonize the codes of practice of their members with the codes of conduct and ensure their legality. At its last meeting, the EDPB also adopted the Guidelines on Certification and Accreditation, including its annexes. The guidelines will assist Member States, supervisory and accreditation bodies and certification bodies in establishing certification under the General Regulation. Following the technical review, the guidelines will be available on the EDPB website: https: //edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/general-guidance/gdpr-guidelines-recommendations-best-practices_en EDPB press release: https: // edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2019/european-data-protection-board-eleventh-plenary-session-guidelines-codes-conduct_en
