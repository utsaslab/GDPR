The Information Commissioner has issued a new form to help individuals exercise their right to data portability. It is a new right granted to individuals by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which allows individuals to obtain their data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable form and to request the direct transfer of their personal data to another controller (Article 20 of the General Regulation). Individuals can thus obtain their information e.g. about the purchases made, the use of the services or their activities, and they are transferred to themselves or to another manager. In this way it may be possible to obtain or request the transfer of data if it has been collected on the basis of consent or a contract, but does not apply to personal data which is kept by law or in the public interest; the data must be processed electronically in order to request their electronic copy or transmission. Data portability does not mean that the controller has to delete the data, but rather a right to use a useful electronic copy of his / her own data (eg in csv, txt, xml format). The right to portability can allow more competition between data controllers and give individuals more control over their own data. By exercising this right, we will be able to determine &quot;how much we are worth&quot; for certain service providers and make it easier to navigate between them.
