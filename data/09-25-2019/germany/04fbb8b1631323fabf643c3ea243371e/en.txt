08.06.2018EUGH confirms responsibility of the operators of Facebook fanpages! | 05/2018

In its judgment of 5 June 2018, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) confirmed the legal opinion of the German data protection authorities. The Conference of the Independent Data Protection Authorities of the Federation and the Länder has published the attached Resolution, which describes the effects of the judgment in more detail.
By setting up a Facebook fan page, the operator Facebook opens the possibility to process personal data of visitors. In addition, through its own design of its offer, it contributes to Facebook setting cookies or generating statistics. In order to target his offer, the fanpage operator can use the demographic data generated by Facebook such as age, gender, relationship status or professional situation.
The State Commissioner for Data Protection and the Right to File Access Brandenburg Dagmar Hartge welcomes the judgment of the ECJ:
"The operators of a fan page are now required to actively implement the requirements of data protection law, in particular the General Data Protection Regulation, and to ensure transparency in data processing. They can not escape this responsibility any further. There is an urgent need for action. "
What the fanpage operators now have to do in detail can be found in the attached resolution.
