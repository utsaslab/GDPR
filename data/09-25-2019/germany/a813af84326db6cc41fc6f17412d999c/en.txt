PRESS RELEASE

Working Paper on Privacy and Artificial Intelligence released
The International Working Group on Data Protection in Telecommunications (so-called Berlin
Group), chaired by the Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Maja
Smoltczyk, has passed a Working Paper on Privacy and Artificial Intelligence at its 64th meeting
in Queenstown (New Zealand) on 29 and 30 November 2018. After a written procedure the Working
Paper has been finally adopted.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is high on the agenda of many business sectors due to its perceived potential for radically improving services, commercial break-throughs and financial gains. It is expected
that the next five years will see the pervasive implementation of AI technologies. AI systems generally require the processing of huge volumes of data for their development. In a number of cases, these
data are personal data, potentially impacting on individuals’ rights to data protection and to privacy.
The Working Paper on Privacy and Artificial Intelligence highlights the privacy challenges associated
with the development and use of AI. It provides a set of technical recommendations to help developers of AI systems, system providers, organisations purchasing and using AI systems, and Data Protection Authorities to mitigate privacy risks.
