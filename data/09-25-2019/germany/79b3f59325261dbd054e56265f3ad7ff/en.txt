PRESS RELEASE
Working Paper on Connected Vehicles released
The International Working Group on Data Protection in Telecommunications (so-called Berlin
Group), chaired by the Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Maja
Smoltczyk, has adopted the Working Paper on Connected Vehicles at its 63rd meeting in Budapest (Hungary) on 9 and 10 April 2018.
As vehicles become increasingly connected to the Internet and to other vehicles, more and more
personal data will be collected and processed by the vehicles. Relevant types of data collected by
the vehicle’s sensors may concern driver behaviour or information about other people inside or outside the vehicle. This data may be processed by the vehicle’s IT systems, or when other personal
devices connect to it. The advent of autonomous vehicles will raise additional privacy issues, as their
functioning will require the collection and use of significant amounts of data.
The Working Paper on Connected Vehicles analyzes the different types of data that can be collected, generated, transmitted, processed or retained by connected vehicles and identifies the privacy
risks involved in these processes. The Working Paper provides recommendations for manufacturers,
third party service providers, standardization bodies, public authorities and rule makers as well as for
drivers of connected vehicles on how to effectively avert these risks.

About the International Working Group on Data Protection in Telecommunications (“Berlin Group”)
The International Working Group on Data Protection in Telecommunications (IWGDPT, also known as “Berlin
Group”) includes representatives from Data Protection Authorities and international organisations dealing with
privacy matters from all over the world. It was founded in 1983 in the framework of the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners at the initiative of the Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection, who has since then been chairing the Group. The Group has adopted numerous recommendations
(“Common Positions” and “Working Papers”) aimed at improving the protection of privacy in telecommunications. Since the beginning of the 90s the Group has focused particularly on the protection of privacy on the
Internet.
