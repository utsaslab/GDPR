PRESS RELEASE

Working Paper on Wide Area Location Tracking released
The International Working Group on Data Protection in Telecommunications (so-called Berlin
Group), chaired by the Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Maja
Smoltczyk, has passed a Working Paper on Wide Area Location Tracking at its 64th meeting in
Queenstown (New Zealand) on 29 and 30 November 2018. After a written procedure the Working
Paper has been finally adopted.
Physical location tracking, namely the ability of modern technology to follow individuals’ movements and keep a record of them, is an area where people’s real and virtual lives meet. In the
past walking, driving, riding a bicycle or jogging were activities with very limited risks of being
tracked. However, they are now becoming increasingly connected activities, and being tracked is
becoming the norm. There is a great public interest in taking advantage of the opportunities and
benefits of the new technologies. Data from devices installed in cars can be used to improve road
use efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions, or to improve the safety of drivers and pedestrians.
“Smart city” services can create public benefits, like making public services more effective and
cost efficient. However, the discovery and use of patterns from mobility flows must be balanced
by the protection of the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned.
The Working Paper on Wide Area Location Tracking examines the data protection and privacy
risks associated with large scale collection of location data in the public interest. It gives recommendations to Organisations, industry and regulators for lawful implementation, and for possible
technical and organizational arrangements ensuring to mitigate the risks.
