18.10.2019Press invitation: freedom of information and journalism - an effective research tool? | 11/2019

On October 28, 2019, the State Commissioner for the Right to Inspect the Files organizes the International Symposium
"Freedom of information and journalism - an effective research tool?"
It takes place between 9:00 and 17:00 at BlauArt Tagungshaus, Werderscher Damm 8, 14471 Potsdam.
Media representatives are cordially invited to report and participate. The attached program can also be found on our website.
In addition to the right to information under the press law, journalists increasingly use the freedom of information laws - especially for longer-term, investigative projects. In international comparison, however, this happens in very different ways. What factors influence the success of journalistic research based on freedom of information?
During the International Symposium, experts from the European Union, from Ireland, Northern Macedonia, Hungary, Austria and Germany will provide insights into their experiences. In addition to classic information-based freedom of information, open data and data journalism will also be an issue. The symposium will be held in German and English with simultaneous translation.
The country representative, Dagmar Hartge, will be happy to assist you during talks with media representatives.
We look forward to your participation and ask for organizational reasons to a registration.

Sven Müller
