The Commissioner for Data Protection and the Right to Access to the Files, Dagmar Hartge, puts on
Tuesday, April 9, 2019 at 9:30
in the state parliament Brandenburg
Press conference room (room E.060 a / b),
Alter Markt 1, 14467 Potsdam
their current activity report on data protection for the year 2018.
At the beginning of the press conference, Ms. Hartge hands over the activity report to the President of the State Parliament, Ms. Britta Stark. She then goes into the main topics of her activity report.
For us, the past year was all about the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation - which is probably the main focus of the report. The associated changes for companies, administrations, associations and last but not least for the authority of the Land Commissioners themselves took up a large part of our activity.
In addition, Ms Hartge will discuss questions about the admissibility of Facebook fanpages and the use of WhatsApp for official purposes. She also explains her position on the amendment of the Brandenburg Police Law and presents interesting cases in which the data protection supervisory authority had to take measures to ensure data protection in the past year. Afterwards, Ms Hartge will be happy to answer any questions.
Media representatives are cordially invited to attend.

Responsible:
Sven MÃ¼ller
