1) calling number (A number) and the name and address of the subscriber or registered user,
2) called number (B number) and the name and address of the subscriber or registered user,

7) the time of commencement and termination of communication and

”[The Data Inspectorate immediately understands] The Ministry of Justice's opinion of 11 May 2017 that telecommunications providers are required under section 4 (6) of the Logging Order to register location data for MMS communication, irrespective of the layout of telecommunications providers' IT systems and that there may be other legislation than the Logging Order, which sets (other) requirements for the construction of telecommunications providers' IT systems, including processing of information in this regard. " In a statement dated May 11, 2017 to the Danish Business Authority, the Ministry of Justice stated the following about the logging order:
”By letter of 30 March 2017, the Danish Business Authority requested the Ministry of Justice an opinion as to whether Section 4 (6) of the Logging Order on MMS communication implies that the mobile operators are obliged to register and store a mobile device's location for certain types of data traffic other than MMS when it (1) the mobile operators must delete or anonymize location data traffic in accordance with section 23 (1) of the contract notice. In this connection, the Ministry of Justice must note that since the contract notice falls under the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Energy, Climate and Supply, the Ministry of Justice has no basis for deciding whether section 23 of the contract notice on the deletion or anonymization of traffic data provides a basis for requiring that In view of the logging rules, the mobile operators' systems must technically be designed in a way that allows the location data for MMS traffic to be separated from the location data for certain other types of mobile data traffic.
