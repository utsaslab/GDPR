The following facts are relevant to the decision: 1. Rudolf D ***, b. **. **. 195 *, has its registered main residence in **** N *** city, T *** gasse * 4 / * 7, since 02.08.1990 and is the operator of the subject video surveillance system (image processing). 2. The subject of the object in question is a multi-party residential complex which is owned by a real estate company and is also managed by it as a property management company. The accused lives in the apartment Top No. 7 of this residential complex. 3. The video surveillance system consists of at least two cameras installed in the door and window area of ​​the apartment Top Nr. * 7. 4. These cameras cover the following areas of the property for general use, located in front of the present multiparty housing complex:  parking lots,  sidewalks,  yard, garden and access areas to the housing estate and  parts of a neighboring property. Furthermore, the subject video surveillance system covers the very personal area of ​​life of roommates, who have to use when walking in and out of their apartments passing the top floor * 7 hallway. An explicit consent of the persons concerned for this is not available. 5. Recorded image data has been published, at least in part, on the Internet on a social media platform, with the published images in four cases clearly indicating the registration plates of parked cars. 6. The subject video surveillance system is not suitably marked. 7. The subject cameras are operated at least since 15.05.2018. At this time, the municipal authorities of the city N *** stadt (by means of an e-mail from those affected) were informed by the cameras. 8. The in the course of the ggst. Procedure issued by RSa letter request for justification from 05.11.2018 was according to Rückschein of Austrian Post AG - after a delivery attempt on 14.11.2018 - from 15.11.2018 held in the post office (****) for collection; Finally, the document - marked with the remark "not repaired" - was returned on 04.12.2018 to the Data Protection Authority. 9. According to Statistik Austria's income report - most recently published for the 2016 reporting year - the average net income of employed men was € 1,883.0 per month. Evidence: Inspection of the content of the former mayor of the city N *** city to GZ. 1 ** 6- * 5- * 6 * 5 * 1 punitive action transmitted on 26.06.2018 including photo supplements, return receipt from Österreichische Post AG, ZMR reconciliation from 18.09.2018, land register inquiry from 18.09.2018, online survey income report of Statistics Austria, https : //www.statistik.at/web_de/statistiken/menschen_und_gesellschaft/soziales/personen-einkommen/nettomonatseinkommen/057212.html, last call on 17.12.2018. II. The findings are made on the basis of the following evidence: 1. The Data Protection Authority lays down the content of the administrative penalty measure sent to the mayor of the city of N *** stadt, including photo supplements, the information on the return receipt of the Austrian Post AG, official inquiries in the central register of migrants and the land register as well as access to the income report of the Federal Statistical Office of Austria based its findings of fact. 2. The findings are based more closely on the credible and substantiated allegations of the private scoreboard, which could also be substantiated by photographs published on the internet by a user of a social media bearing the name of the accused (see e-mails dated 15.05.2018, 17.05.2018 and 14.06.2018); the allegation made in the context of the request for justification remained completely undisputed by the accused, the time limit for justification passed unused and the accused was also at the Vernehmmmetermin before the Data Protection Authority on 30/10/2018 (10:00 clock) stayed away. In addition, the DPA did not receive any justifiable arguments, even up to the time when the penalty was granted. 3. On the basis of the general experience of life, it is considered by the DPA to be largely likely that the cameras in question have not been taken out of service in the meantime; rather, the DPA assumes that the operation is the same in the long run. III. Legally, it follows: On administrative criminal liability: 1. On the legal situation: Art. 83 (5) lit. a GDPR specifies that, in case of infringement of the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 GDPR, fines of up to EUR 20 000 000 or, in the case of a company, up to 4% of its total worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year may be imposed which of the amounts is higher. Pursuant to Section 62 (1) (4) DSG, a fine of up to € 50,000 must be imposed on anyone who operates image processing contrary to the provisions of Section 3 of Section 1 (sections 12 and 13 DSG). Pursuant to Section 69 (5) of the DSG, violations of the DSG 2000 which were not yet pending at the time of the entry into force of the DSG must be assessed in accordance with the legal position following the entry into force of the DSG. A criminal offense, which was realized before the entry into force of the DSG, is to be judged according to the legal position, which is more favorable for the offender in its overall effect; this also applies to the appeal procedure. Since the beginning of the objective conduct before 25 May 2018 - the date of entry into force of the DSG - is the highest possible punishment under § 62 Abs. 1 Z 4 DSG over that according to § 52 paragraph 2 DSG 2000, come in terms of the penalty - so far it violates the DSG 2000 and / or the DSG concerns - the regulations of the DSG 2000 for the application. 2. As stated above, the DPA has carried out the administrative administrative proceedings pursuant to § 42 (1) (2) VStG without hearing the accused. Regarding point 1: 3. In the present case, the operation of the cameras, starting from the door and window area of ​​the apartment in Top * 7 of the subject multi-party housing located by the accused, is undisputedly an image as defined in § 12 paragraph 1 DSG. The DSGVO defines the term processing in Art. 4 no. 2 DSGVO by listing a number of possible uses. This includes collecting, collecting, organizing, organizing, storing, adapting or modifying, reading out, querying, using, disclosing through transmission, distribution or any other form of provisioning, reconciliation or linking , restriction, deletion or annihilation. By raising, storing and transmitting (publishing) the representational image data, the material scope of Art. 2 GDPR is opened. In any case, the recorded image data constitute personal data within the meaning of Art. 4 no. 1 DSGVO and, due to the storage and transmission of the same, in any case also a processing within the meaning of Art. 4 no. 2 DSGVO. The accused is to be qualified as responsible for the present data processing within the meaning of Art 4 Z 7 DSGVO. 4. Art. 5 DSGVO lays down the principles for the processing of personal data and determines its paragraph 1 lit. a that personal data must be lawfully processed, in good faith and in a manner that is reasonable for the data subject ("lawfulness, fairness, transparency"); lit. c leg. cit. lays down as a further principle that any processing must be proportionate, proportionate and limited to what is necessary for the purposes of processing ('data minimization'). Pursuant to Article 6 GDPR, processing is only lawful if at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: (a) the data subject has consented to the processing of personal data concerning him for one or more specific purposes; (b) the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or for the performance of any pre-contractual action taken at the request of the data subject; (c) the processing is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; (d) the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or any other natural person; (e) the processing is necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest or in the exercise of public authority delegated to the controller. (f) the processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject requiring the protection of personal data prevail, in particular where the data subject is a Child acts. As regards the lawfulness of processing operations, recital 47 explains, inter alia, that it may be justified by the legitimate interests of a controller, including a controller to whom the personal data may be disclosed or a third party, provided that the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are concerned Person does not outweigh; In doing so, account must be taken of the reasonable expectations of the person concerned based on his relationship with the person responsible. For example, there could be a legitimate interest if there is a relevant and proportionate relationship between the data subject and the controller, eg. For example, if the data subject is a customer of the person responsible or in his services. In any case, the existence of a legitimate interest should be assessed with particular care, and it must also be considered whether, at the time of the personal data collection and in the circumstances in which it occurs, a data subject may reasonably foresee that there may be processing for that person Purpose will be done. In particular, where personal data are processed in situations where an affected person does not reasonably have to expect further processing, the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject may outweigh the interests of the controller. 5. The reception area of ​​the cameras in question - as stated in section I. - is located in front of the housing complex and intended for general use by all residents, such as yard, garden and car parking areas and parts of a neighboring property. 6. Since neither the defendant 's neighbors nor the persons otherwise covered by the cameras' reception area (such as visitors to residents) are reasonably expected to be photographed, the operation of the image recording infringes the principles of purpose limitation and data minimization. 7. A legal basis on the basis of the lawfulness of data processing within the meaning of Article 6 (1) GDPR is not apparent and has not been put forward by the accused. In particular, the data protection authority does not recognize a legitimate interest in the operation of the image recording with regard to the spatial coverage of the subject image acquisition on the part of the person responsible. Rather, in the present case, the (constitutionally) protected rights to secrecy and protection of the private and family life of neighbors and other affected persons in the sense of § 1 DSG or Art. 7 GRC and Art. 8 ECHR outweigh any possible interest in the operation of the objective image recording. Re. 2: 7. The operation of a video surveillance, starting from an apartment door of a dwelling located in a multi - party dwelling, represents an image acquisition within the meaning of § 12 Abs. 1 DSG: The regulation of § 12 DSG aims at basically all image recordings by persons in charge of the private sector of this provision, insofar as these are not already covered by Article 2 (2) lit. c DSGVO are excluded from the scope of application and do not provide for any other special laws (see Bresich / Dopplinger / Dörnhöfer / Kunnert / Riedl, DSG, § 12, p. Paragraph 12 (1) of the DSG defines, under a picture taken in the sense of the third section of the DSG, the findings of events in public or non-public space made by the use of technical facilities for image processing for private purposes. The term "event" should be understood further. In particular, a mobile video recording should also be recorded. In this sense, the term "image acquisition" should be interpreted broadly and also capture mere records that, although a particular object or a specific person to the content, but not on a "surveillance" (Bresich / Dopplinger / Dörnhöfer / Kunnert / Riedl , DSG, § 12, p. 134). 8. Pursuant to Section 12 (4) (1) of the DSG, it is not permitted to take a picture without the express consent of the person concerned, in whose very personal sphere of life he intervenes. Places, which are to be assigned to the highly personal area of ​​life, are eg. Private apartments, changing rooms or WC cabins (see Pollirer / Weiss / Knyrim / Haidinger, Data Protection Act, § 12, note 12). 9. The Supreme Court has ruled that private viewing, continued unwanted surveillance and persecution constitute a violation of privacy rights protected by Article 8 of the ECHR in respect of privacy and the secret sphere of a person; the protection of the privacy of a tenant from such measures does not end at the inner door; it is a legitimate interest to grant that the tenant or his roommates or guests do not fully monitor and record the entering or leaving of an apartment; it is essentially not a question of whether such monitoring is also recorded, because it already represents a serious impairment of privacy (secret sphere), if an affected person by the nature of the attachment and appearance seems to be exposed to constant monitoring pressure (cf OGH from 17 December 2013, 5 Ob 69 / 13b). 10. From this, it can be deduced for the present proceedings that the very personal sphere of life in principle also includes the exterior of an apartment door in accordance with § 12 (4) (1) DSG, as this can cover the entry and exit of the affected person's home (cf. also the decision of the DPA dated 22 August 2014, DC DSB-D215.463 / 0006-DSB / 2014). 11. From the reception area of ​​the camera installed in the door of the apartment to Top Nr. * 7 - as under point I.4. - also the hallway area in front of it, which leads to further housing units situated within the multi-party housing estate. Since the highly personal sphere of life includes rooms to which only a limited circle of persons known to the person entitled has access, e.g. a private apartment, the procedural image processing of a justifying balance of interests is not accessible. Such image processing would be permissible only with the express consent of the person concerned, which is not physically present. As to Section 3: 12. Pursuant to Section 13 (5) of the DSG, the person in charge of taking pictures must mark them appropriately. In any case, the person responsible must clearly state from the marking, unless he is already familiar with the persons concerned according to the circumstances of the case. The marking must be made locally in such a way that any potentially affected person approaching a monitored object has the possibility of avoiding video surveillance as far as possible. A similar arrangement was provided for by Section 50d (1) DSG 2000. 13. This is not possible in the present case, as there are no signs in the outdoor area or in the access areas of the housing complex and in the hallway in front of Top No. * 7 are attached. 14. Consequently, the non-fulfillment of this obligation in the present case infringes § 13 (5) in conjunction with § 62 (1) 4 DSG and, for the period prior to 25 May 2018, § 52 (2) 4 in conjunction with § 50d DSG 2000. 15. Applying the requirements and obligations of §§ 12 f DSG on the facts, the cognizant authority comes to the conclusion that the person in charge of the subject image recording exclusively in compliance with the requirements for admissibility and proportionality of § 12 DSG, Art 5 and 6 DSGVO and in compliance with the condition in § 12 para 4 no. 1 as well as the obligation under § 13 para 5 DSG should have operated. 16. Against the background of the facts established as proven, the accused as controller has, under Article 4 (7) GDPR, the objective fact of the administrative breach of Art. 83 (5) lit. a DSGVO and § 62 para. 1 no. 4 DSG and § 52 para. 2 no. 4 DSG 2000, respectively. 17. In the case of administrative offenses whose image is a mere violation of a prohibition or non-observance of a command and which does not provide for damage or danger (disobedience), if the offender is iSd Paragraph 5 (1) of the VStG does not make it credible that he is not to blame for the breach of the administrative provision (see VwGH, 18.6.1990, 91/09/0132). There is a presumption of culpability from the outset (eg VwGH, 18.6.1999, 89/10/0221). It is up to the accused to make it clear that he was unable to comply with the administrative provisions without his fault. In order to substantiate lack of fault, it must be stated that the accused has taken measures which, under the foreseeable circumstances, could reasonably be expected to comply with the statutory provisions. 18. The defendant has not alleged that compliance with the provisions of the GDPR and §§ 12 and 13 DSG and §§ 50a ff DSG 2000 would not have been possible. IV. As regards sentencing, it must be stated that: 1. According to § 19 Abs. 1 VStG, the basis for the assessment of the punishment is the meaning of the criminally protected property and the intensity of its impairment by the act. Moreover, according to the purpose of the threat of punishment, the relevant grounds for aggravation and mitigation, if they do not already determine the threat of punishment, must be weighed up against each other. Particular attention should be paid to the extent of the fault. Taking into account the peculiar nature of administrative criminal law, §§ 32 to 35 of the Criminal Code are to be applied mutatis mutandis. The income and financial circumstances and any liability of the accused person must be taken into account when calculating fines. In the area of ​​application of the GDPR, all circumstances of Art. 83 (2) GDPR must be taken into account in the sentencing. In the present case, the income and assets and any due diligence obligations could not be taken into account - due to the lack of cooperation of the accused. The authority therefore had to proceed with an assessment of the income and assets (see VwGH of 27 April 2000, 98/10/0003). In this case, the accused must attribute his failure to cooperate should the authority have disregarded circumstances that could not have come to the knowledge of the defendant without his participation (see VwGH of 31.01.2012, 2009/05 / 0123). Taking into account the values ​​published by the Federal Statistical Office - last year for the reporting year 2016 - the average monthly net income of employed men of € 1,883.00 was reduced by the data protection authority from an average monthly net income of the defendant of around € 1,800 went out. 2. The provisions of §§ 12 f DSG and Art. 5 and 6 DSGVO aim to protect the fundamental rights protected legal positions of those affected against encroachments by images used in public or non-public space for private purposes that do not meet the requirements with regard to their admissibility and proportionality. The prohibition set out in Section 12 (4) (1) DSG explicitly prohibits the person responsible for image acquisition from taking pictures of their very personal spheres of life without the express consent of the persons concerned. The provision of § 13 (5) of the DSG is intended to enable those affected to avoid (unwanted) image acquisition wherever possible and to determine who is responsible for the image acquisition. 3. In the case in point, when determining the penalty it had to be taken into account that the unlawful operation of the image capture was potentially suitable, a large number of stakeholders, in this case neighbors of the accused or community resident and users of general parts of the housing estate and public Traffic areas in which rights protected by fundamental rights - in particular their right to secrecy within the meaning of § 1 DSG and their right to respect for private and family life within the meaning of Art. 7 GRC or Art. 8 ECHR - are infringed. The fact that the neighbors regard their quality of life as limited by the constant observation by the accused is clear from their e-mail traffic with the city magistrate of the city of N ***. 4. The alleged infringement is considered to be difficult due to the high degree of wrongdoing and the fact that it is a systematic violation of the obligation of the person responsible. Finally, several cameras in the outer area of ​​the apartment in Top Nr. * 7 systematically create images of general areas of the housing complex, as well as beyond that of the very personal area of ​​life of those affected; The recordings were also (at least in part) published on the Internet and thus made accessible to an indefinite audience. 5. That was therefore to be considered as aggravating, with the intensity of the interference resulting from the operation of unacceptable and unrelated image processing, which covers both public space and the highly personal sphere of life, in this case based on the separate penalties awarded for individual points of appeal Relation to each other - has struck down accordingly. A waiver of the imposition is therefore out of the question. The duration of the infringement - the image capture is as stated for at least several months in operation - was also considered to be aggravating. 6. Therefore, and in order to prevent the accused from further criminal acts of the same kind, it was necessary to impose a penalty in this particular case. The need for special prevention also results from the fact that the defendant has not yet taken out of operation the cameras in question. 7. Regarding the degree of fault or the extent of the fault of the responsible accused, at least negligent behavior was assumed. Negligent behavior is neither mitigated nor taken into account. 8. It was considered mitigating that there were no relevant reservations against the defendant.
