The appeal is granted and it is determined that the Respondent has violated the complainant's right to secrecy by notifying the decision of the District Commission B *** dated 4.10.2017, GZ Agrar01 - 2 * 5 - 2017, BHB * Jagd-2017- * 4 * 1 * 7/3-K **, including the personal data of the complainant (function, name, postal address, e-mail address) contained therein by means of a link on the website with the URL "http : //members.g***isp.at/N***/naturB*Exceptions.htm "(Url of Notice as PDF document:" http: //j***berg.info/natur_B*Inquiry3Changes *** hausen.pdf "). 2. The Respondent is instructed to remove the personal data of the Complainant pursuant to point 1 within a period of four weeks in case of other execution. Legal basis: §§ 1 (1), 24 (1) and (5) of the Data Protection Act (DSG), BGBl. I No. 165/1999 as amended; Art. 58 para. 2 lit. d, Art. 77 General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR, OJ. 1. REASONS A. Arguments of the parties and procedure 1. The complainant alleged a breach of the fundamental right to data protection and in his complaint of 30.5.2018, received by the DPA on 7.6.2018, in essence, he be hunting director of the hunting party E *** hausen and thus appear in the decision of the district captain B *** from 4.10.2017, GZ Agrar01 - 2 * 5 - 2017, BHB * Jagd-2017- * 4 * 1 * 7/3-K ** concerning the order for compulsory launching of goshawk and buzzards as delivery agent. However, he did not hold a public office. In this decision personal data (name, postal and e-mail address) are given by him. The Respondent requested and finally received this decision from the District Commission B *** in the context of the environmental information law. The personal data had not been anonymised by the Bezirkshauptmannschaft B ***, but the Respondent had been informed by the Respondent of the Privacy Policy in case of publication. The Respondent published this notice in its entirety and without anonymization on its website http: //members.g***isp.at/N***/naturB*Ausnahmen.htm. The Respondent was requested by letter of 29.3.2018 to delete or anonymise the relevant data. However, he had not complied with this request. 2. The Respondent's statement of 20 June 2018 essentially stated that the published documents were environmental information and had been submitted by the Authority on the basis of the Environmental Information Acts (UIG, Oö USchG). The purpose of Directive 2003/4 / EC, implemented in the Environmental Information Acts, is to inform the public about the environment. A restriction of the use of environmental information, which was communicated on the basis of the environmental information laws, contradicts the UVS Vienna according to the meaning and regulation purpose of these laws. The anonymization of sensitive information is subject to the information authority. With regard to the recitals of Directive 2003/4 / EC and § 6 (3) UIG, there is no legitimate interest in secrecy if secrecy is merely due to a reduction in the reputation of the party in public as a result of becoming aware of environmentally harmful activities. The complainant was listed in the published documents in the exercise of public function as a hunting director (§ 21 para 3 Oö Hunting Act) and district hunters master (§ 85 Oö Hunting Act), so that no secrecy interests were violated. Name, function, address, e-mail and telephone number are also available on the website of the Landesjagdverband. 3. By observations of 17.8.2018, the complainant essentially submitted that the Oö. Environmental protection law as well as the UIG is the information of the public about the environment, but not the personal vilification of persons and publication of personal data. B. Object of the complaint On the basis of the complainant's submission, the subject of the complaint is the question whether the Respondent published his function, name, and the complainant's postal and e-mail address on his website, cited in the Notice of District B * ** of 4.10.2017, GZ Agrar01 - 2 * 5 - 2017, BHB * Jagd-2017- * 4 * 1 * 7/3-K **, violated the complainant's right to secrecy pursuant to § 1 DSG. C. Determination of facts 1. The Respondent has received the decision of the District Commission B *** dated 4.10.2017, GZ Agrar01 - 2 * 5 - 2017, BHB * Jagd-2017- * 4 * 1 * 7/3-K ** Basis of the Environmental Information Act (UIG, Oö USchG) obtained from the District Commission B *** with full personal reference and published on its website. 2. There is no consent of the complainant concerning the publication of his personal data. 3. The URL http: //members.g***isp.at/N***/naturB*Ausnahmen.htm is excerpted as follows (formatting not reproduced 1: 1): [Note Editor: This one in the original A screenshot of the website rendered as a graphic file can not be pseudonymised at a reasonable cost. It contains links to two notices under the heading "Exemptions Hunting and Conservation Area B ***". 4. With point C.3. visible link "Agrar01 - 2 * 5 - 2017, BHB * Jagd-2017- * 4 * 1 * 7/3-K **" you get to the decision of the district captain B *** from 4.10.2017, GZ Agrar01 - 2 * 5 - 2017, BHB * Jagd-2017- * 4 * 1 * 7/3-K **, as PDF document with the URL http: //j***berg.info/natur_B*Anfrage3BescheidE***hausen. pdf. In this decision function, name, postal address and e-mail address of the complainant are given (formatting not reproduced 1: 1): [Note editor: The here in the original reproduced as a graphic file notice can not be pseudonymized with reasonable effort. It contains the commissioned order for the shooting of buzzards and goshawk directed to the Hunting Company E *** hausen, including ancillary provisions, grounds and distributors.] Proof of evidence: Evidence was provided by the submissions of the parties and by an official search on the Respondent's website. D. From a legal point of view, it follows: 1. The legal position The legal position prevailing at the time of the decision of the Data Protection Authority, unless it concerns the assessment of conduct at a certain point in time. The subject of the complaint is not based on a specific deadline or period, but the alleged infringement is still pending, so that the legal situation at the time of the decision of the data protection authority is therefore decisive. 2. For publication: 1. The data on which the complaint is based (function, name, postal address, e-mail address) are personal data within the meaning of Art. 4 no. 1 DSGVO. 2. The Federal Law on Access to Information on the Environment (Environmental Information Act - UIG) and the Provincial Act of 4 July 1996 on Measures for the Protection of the Environment and Access to Information on the Environment (Upper Austrian Environmental Protection Act 1996 - Oö USchG) (inter alia) the right of free access to environmental information held by or available to the information providers. According to § 3 para. 1 no. 1 UIG or § 14 para. 1 no. 1 Oö. USchG about administrative authorities. The applicability of the UIG or Oö. USchG depends on whether the environmental information relates to matters that are in the legislation of the country (§ 14 para 1 Oö USchG) or federal matter (§ 3 para 1 UIG). The purpose of these provisions is thus to regulate the public's access to environmental information in bodies subject to information requirements. 3. However, this case-law does not deal with the relationship with the Bezirkshauptmannschaft B *** as a body requiring information, but with the lawfulness of the publication by the respondent of the (non-anonymised) decision received under the above-mentioned provisions. Thus, in the present proceedings, it may be left undecided whether the district headquarters B *** should have made an anonymization. The provision of § 6 (3) UIG, which was introduced by the Respondent, in turn only regulates the communication of environmental information by bodies subject to the obligation of information and would otherwise only apply if the environmental information relates to matters in the Federal legislation (§ 3 para. 1 UIG). Rather, the Respondent himself was responsible for examining whether the publication of the decision could be made with full personal reference. 4. Neither EU nor Austrian law gives general priority to informing the public of the right to the protection of personal data. Rather, it requires a case-by-case assessment whether the publication of information outweighs the right to the protection of personal data. Specifically, it was therefore necessary to examine whether the publication of the above-mentioned decision with full personal reference was covered by Art. 6 DSGVO or § 1 (2) DSG. Since - as stated - there is no consent of the complainant with respect to the publication of his personal data (Art. 6 (1) a DSGVO and § 1 (2) 2 DSG case), in the specific case the legal basis is only processing the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR and Article 1 (2) 3rd case DSG). However, this is subject to the proviso that the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail. It can not be said that the publication in question in any case outweighs the applicant's fundamental right to privacy. The respondent's argument that a restriction on the use of environmental information communicated on the basis of the abovementioned Environmental Information Acts is contrary to the spirit and purpose of those laws must be countered by the fact that it is not necessary to publish the complainant's personal data in order to comply with The purpose and purpose of the above-mentioned regulations. Rather, it is about informing the public about the ordered compulsory launch of three pieces of goshawks and buzzards in the cooperative hunting area E *** hausen. 5. The fact that the complainant's personal data published by the Respondent is in any case on the website of the Oö. Can not already lead to the fact that these personal data are generally available within the meaning of § 1 paragraph 1 DSG. If that were answered in the affirmative, a legitimate interest in the secrecy of data - simply because it can also be found anywhere on the Internet - would always be ruled out, even if the available data were linked to others - not universally available. 6. The publication of the complainant's personal data is therefore unnecessary and therefore not justified. Thus, the lawfulness of the processing carried out by the Respondent to this extent is lacking. 7. The Data Protection Authority shall issue the instruction pursuant to Art. 58 para. 2 lit. DSGVO to the Respondent to remove the personal data on the complainant appearing on the Respondent's website as appropriate to bring the processing operations into conformity with the GDPR. The appeal was therefore to be upheld in accordance with the rules.
