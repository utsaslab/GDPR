I No. 165/1999 as amended by Federal Law Gazette I No. 83/2013 (for the period from 19.04.2018 to 24.05.2018)  § 13 para. 5 DSG, BGBl. I No. 165/1999 as amended (for the period from 25.05.2018 to 04.11.2018) Re 2):  Art. 5 para. 1 lit. a and c and Art. 6 para. 1 DSGVO (for the period from 25/05/2018 to 04/11/2018) However, a penalty is waived and a warning is given to the XY club. Legal basis: § 45 (1) last sentence of the Administrative Penal Code 1991 - VStG, BGBl. Nr. 52 as amended. Reasons: I. The following facts are relevant to the decision: I.1. The XY Verein has operated a video surveillance system at the location 1XX0 Vienna, XXstraße 37, at least from 19.04.2018 until the removal of the cameras. I.2. The cameras were directed towards the public area at the front entrance area. I.3. The cameras were in any case in the period from 19.04.2018 until the dismantling of the cameras not (suitable) marked. 1.4. The installation and operation of the cameras was initiated by persons who acted either alone or as part of an entity of the legal entity and a managerial position within the legal entity on the basis of: 1. the power to represent the legal entity, 2. the power to make decisions in the legal entity 3) have a control authority within the legal entity, or lack of supervision or control by one of the named persons has enabled the installation and operation of the two cameras by a person acting for the legal entity. I.5. By letter dated 02.12.2018, the DPA was informed that the cameras in question had since been removed. Proof: Administrative Act of the City of Vienna - Municipal District Office for the ***. District to do number MBA XXX, advertisement of the state police station Vienna from 23.04.2018 to do GZ XXX resp. GZ XXX, supplementary report of the city police command XXX from 04.11.2018 to GZ XXX including photo supplement, official register extract as well as justification of the accused on 02.12.2018 ( Logged under GZ DSB-D550 / XXX-DSB / 2018). II. The findings are based on the following evidence: II.1. The Data Protection Authority lays out the content of the Municipal Authority of Vienna - Magistratisches Bezirksamt für die ***. District by letter dated 07.06.2018 sent to the Data Protection Authority of the State Police Vienna on 23.04.2018 and its supplementary report including photo supplements from 04.11.2018 as well as the justification of the accused on 02.12.2018 based on their findings of fact. II.2. On the basis of the statement of Mr. XXX, who was to recognize the police officers in the official act of 19.04.2018 as the representative of the association, the data protection authority comes to the conclusion that the installation and operation of the two cameras by persons carried out or arranged who have acted either alone or as part of a legal person's body and have a management position within the legal entity on the basis of: 1. the power to represent the legal person, 2. the power to make decisions on behalf of the legal person, or 3. or that lack of supervision or control by any such person has enabled the installation and operation of the two cameras, by a person acting on behalf of the legal entity. II.3. The findings are based on the statements made by the police on 19.04.2018 at 17:40 on-site findings - in conjunction with the supplementary surveys on site on 04.11.2018, in which it was determined in each case that the camera angles are set so that the Cameras capture public space. The credibility of the findings, in particular due to the duty and disciplinary responsibility of police officers and the photo supplements from the survey on 04.11.2018 is no doubt. The unlawful operation of the subject cameras was ultimately granted by the accused in his submission of 02.12.2018; the accused did not comment on the missing marking. Furthermore, no suitable marking was visible on the slides. The accused has argued that the club understood that the cameras in question would not comply with the law and pointed out that the cameras had been removed with "immediate effect". III. Legally, it follows: III.1. Pursuant to section 30 (1) and (2) in conjunction with section 62 (3) of the DSG, the DPA may impose fines or other administrative penalties on a legal entity in the event of breaches of the provisions of the GDPR and of Section 1 or Article 2 1. Main section Data Protection Act (DSG) were committed by persons who acted either alone or as part of an entity of the legal person and have a management position within the legal entity on the basis of: 1. the power to represent the legal person; 2. the power to make decisions on behalf of the legal person , or 3. have control over the legal entity. Legal persons may also be held responsible for violations of the provisions of the GDPR and § 1 or Article 2 of the Principal DSG if the lack of supervision or control by one of the above-mentioned persons has enabled them to commit these violations by a person acting for the legal entity if the act does not constitute the offense of an offense within the jurisdiction of the courts. III.2. Pursuant to Section 62 (1) (4) DSG, a fine of up to EUR 50,000 is imposed on anyone who operates image processing contrary to the provisions of Section 3 of the main section (Sections 12 and 13 DSG). III.3. Pursuant to Section 69 (5) of the DSG, violations of the DSG 2000 which were not yet pending at the time of the entry into force of the DSG must be assessed in accordance with the legal position following the entry into force of the DSG. A criminal offense, which was realized before the entry into force of the DSG, is to be judged according to the legal position, which is more favorable for the offender in its overall effect; this also applies to appeal proceedings. III.4. Art. 83 (5) lit. a GDPR specifies that, in the event of a breach of the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 of the GDPR, fines of up to EUR 20 000 000 or, in the case of a company, up to 4% of its total worldwide annual turnover in the previous financial year may be imposed, which of the amounts is higher. III.5. Pursuant to § 45 (1) last sentence of the VStG, the authority can issue a notice to the accused, pointing out the unlawfulness of his conduct, if this appears necessary to prevent him from committing criminal acts of the same kind. Re. Point 1: III.6. According to § 50d Abs. 1 DSG 2000, a person in charge of a video surveillance has to identify them appropriately. In any case, the person responsible must clearly state from the marking, unless he is already familiar with the persons concerned according to the circumstances of the case. The labeling must be carried out locally in such a way that every potentially affected person approaching the monitored area has the opportunity to avoid video surveillance as far as possible. Similarly, the wording of § 13 (5) DSG: "The person responsible for a picture must mark this suitable. In any event, the person responsible must clearly state from the marking, unless the person concerned is already aware of the circumstances of the case. "Consequently, failure to comply with that obligation for the period from 19.04.2018 to 04.11.2018 was a breach Section 50d (1) of the DSG 2000 and Section 13 (5) of the DSG. Regarding item 2: III.7. Based on the period between 25/05/2018 (entry into force of the GDPR and the related facts) and 04.11.2018, the reception area of ​​the cameras in question covered public space and was thus not limited to areas which are the exclusive power of disposal of the person in charge ; Image processing was therefore not adequate for the purpose of processing and was not limited to the necessary level. Before 25.05.2018, the DSG 2000 had not provided for its own offense for the filming of public space. Consequently, the operation of the image recording in the period from 25.05.2018 to 04.11.2018 violates the principles set out in Art. 5 GDPR, in particular because the person responsible for the achievement of its purpose - namely the preventive protection of persons or property - the camera could have operated by adjusting the angle of view in such a way as to avoid having to cover the surrounding public traffic areas. IV. For sentencing it must be stated: IV.1. Pursuant to Section 45 (1) (4) of the VStG, the authority may refrain from initiating or carrying out criminal proceedings and may cease its appointment if the significance of the property protected by criminal law and the intensity of its impairment are negligible as a result of the act and the fault of the accused. IV.2. Instead of having recruited, the authority may issue a reminder to the defendant in the case of point 4, citing the unlawfulness of his conduct, if so required, in order to prevent him from committing criminal acts of the same kind. IV.3. Having regard to the findings made under point II. Above or under point III.6. Above. and III.7. resulting legal considerations, as well as the previous data protection immunity of the accused the cognizant authority assumes that it was indeed a one-time misconduct; this, especially since the accused has rectified the illegal condition by removing the camera (no later than 02.12.2018). It was therefore possible to refrain from imposing a fine. At the same time, however, reference is made to the unlawfulness of the legal conduct for the period of action until 04.11.2018, in order to prevent the accused from further punishable acts of the same kind.
