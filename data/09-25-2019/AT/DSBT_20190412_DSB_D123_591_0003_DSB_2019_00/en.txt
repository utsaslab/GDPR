Legal basis: §§ 1 (1) and (2), 22 (4), 24 (1) and (5) and 25 (1) of the Data Protection Act (DSG), BGBl. I No. 165/1999 as amended; Art. 4 Z 1-2, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f and Art. 9 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR), OJ C. No. L 199 of 4.5.2016, p. 1; § 2 and Part 1 Z 10 of the appendix to § 2 of the Federal Ministries Act 1986 - BMG, BGBl. Nr. 76/1986 idgF; § 9 of the Media Act - MedienG, BGBl. Nr. 314/1981 as amended; Section 57 (1) of the General Administrative Procedure Act 1991 - AVG, BGBl. Nr. 51/1991 idgF. EXPLANATORY STATEMENT A. Arguments of the parties and procedure 1. In his submission of 9 October 2018, as amended on 11 October 2018, the complainant essentially submitted to the DPA that the respondents had on his website the complainant's correspondence with the respondent's staff published in full text. By publishing the text of his e-mails and his SMS and by publishing the fact that the communication had taken place, the complainant had been violated in his right to secrecy and deletion and the Respondent had violated his information obligations. For this reason, the complainant also requested an action pursuant to Section 25 (1) DSG. 2. The DPA dismissed the complainant's complaint concerning a breach of the right to erasure on 22 October 2018, as the complainant had not filed a request for cancellation to the respondent. As regards the alleged breach of the right to secrecy and breach of information obligations, the respondent was invited to comment. 3. The Respondent replied in a statement of 3 December 2018 summarized that the complainant had even before the publication of the correspondence by the Respondent itself a message published on Twitter, from which the personal data of the complainant, specifically e-mail address and name of the complainant , as well as the name of the recipient are apparent. As a result, the complainant's interest in maintaining confidentiality was not protected. The complainant was also a representative of a medium and was also the circumstance of the contact by newspaper article published by the complainant. Even if the complaint was reasoned in principle, the processing took place on the basis of the performance of a public interest mission, namely to maintain public confidence in the Federal Ministry of the Interior, and found the appropriate legal basis in the BMG. If necessary, § 9 MedienG is also relevant, which also grants authorities the right of reply. Nor does the respondent breach the principle of good faith or purpose limitation, since he used the data in the same way as the appellant, namely to prove disputed circumstances. There was also no breach of data minimization, as publication in full text was necessary due to the message also published in full text by the complainant in order to achieve the same credibility value. Furthermore, no breach of the information obligations had taken place, as the required information on the website of the Federal Ministry of the Interior were evident. 4. With party hearing of 13 December 2018, the DPA declared that the complaint regarding a breach of the information obligation by the respondent's reaction was deemed to be devoid of purpose and to suspend the proceedings pursuant to § 24 (6) DSG, unless the complainant within a period of two Weeks justified, why he considers the original alleged infringement at least partially still not eliminated. Despite the request, the complainant did not submit further arguments in this respect. 4. On 27 December 2018, the complainant expressed his views on the Respondent's opinion only in respect of a breach of the confidentiality right, alleging in essence that he had not himself published the confidential communications published by the Respondent Nor does it fulfill the requirements of § 1 (1) sentence 2 DSG. In addition, neither the Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) found an appropriate legal basis for the publication of its data, nor was Article 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO applicable to authorities. Furthermore, the complainant alleged that the communication in question was sensitive data because his political opinion was identifiable and, in addition, did not comply with the data protection statement of the respondent in the respondent's actions. B. Object of the complaint On the basis of the appellant's allegation, it emerges that the subject of the complaint is whether the Respondent infringed upon the complainant's fundamental right to secrecy by publishing the textual passages on the website. C. Factual findings The respondent criticized, on the basis of a published newspaper article, that the complainant had not sufficiently sought an opinion during his research. The complainant then published on October 2, 2019 at 8:08 clock via Twitter, the following message including screenshot of an e-mail: [The here in the original of the Bescheidtexts as a facsimile (screenshot, graphic file) reproduced Twitter message can not be pseudonymized with reasonable effort. It has the following content: "BMI claims now that I have not asked for an interview. That's wrong. Inquiry also from KC and press officer [Link to APA-OTS-Announcement] [Quote of an E-Mail to the BMI-employee H ***] Subject: Interview request Dear Mr. H ***, I would like to have an authorized one with Herbert Kickl Interview for the upcoming issue of the B *** magazine.

I think that would be an exciting and clarifying conversation. Is that possible? Sincerely, Ludwig A *** "Evaluation of evidence: The findings are based on the submissions of the Respondent as well as on an official search (query on Twitter) of the Data Protection Authority, which also results in the attached screenshot. The Respondent then published on October 2, 2018 at 19:18 clock on his website the following text passages and linked via Twitter (formatting not reproduced 1: 1): "Coffeehouse appointments: BMI published chronology of A *** - requests since 25 September A *** wanted interview and introductory talks, but did not confront the Ministry of the Interior with concrete allegations.

For the complete information of all media the BMI presents a chronology of the contacts by A *** in the course of its researches to the current reports: On September 25th at 17:42 o'clock Ludwig A *** directed the following mail from his private address to the Head of Department Communication Department, BMI: Dear Mr. H ***, I would like to have an authorized interview with Herbert Kickl for the upcoming issue of the B *** Magazine. I think that would be an exciting and clarifying conversation. Is that possible? Yours sincerely, Ludwig A. *** Lacking responsibility, the communications department head forwarded this mail to the personal press spokesman of Interior Minister Kickl and informed A *** about it at 08:25 on 26 September.

Accusations may not be made without demonstrably attempting to obtain an opinion from the accused person (s) or institution (s). If the complaint is a public accusation, this must be clearly indicated. "The complainant did not agree to this publication. The text passages have since been deleted from the Respondent's website. Proof of evidence: The findings made are based on the parties' allegations. D. From a legal point of view: D.1. Procedural Legal Basis: The constitutional provision of § 1 paragraph 1 and 2 DSG is including headline (emphasis by the Data Protection Authority): Fundamental right to privacy § 1. (1) Everyone has, in particular with regard to the respect of his private and family life claim confidentiality of personal data concerning him, as far as there is a legitimate interest in it. The existence of such interest is excluded if data is not available for confidentiality because of its general availability or lack of traceability to the data subject. (2) Insofar as the use of personal data does not take place in the vital interest of the data subject or with his consent, restrictions on the right to secrecy are only permissible for the protection of the overriding legitimate interests of another, in the case of interventions of a state authority only by virtue of laws, which are necessary for the reasons set out in Article 8 (2) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), Federal Law Gazette No 210/1958. Such laws may provide for the use of data of a particular worthy of protection only for the purpose of safeguarding important public interests and at the same time provide adequate safeguards for the protection of the data subjects' confidentiality interests. Even in the case of admissible limitations, the interference with the fundamental right may only be carried out in the best possible way. Article 4 (1) and (2) GDPR including heading (Emphasized by the Data Protection Authority): Article 4 Definitions For the purposes of this Regulation: 1. "personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter referred to as "personal data") "Affected person"); a natural person is considered as being identifiable, directly or indirectly, in particular by means of an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one or more special characteristics expressing the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of this natural person can be identified; 2. "processing" means any process performed with or without the aid of automated processes, or any such series relating to personal data such as collecting, collecting, organizing, organizing, storing, adapting or modifying, reading out, querying, the use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or other form of provision, matching or linking, restriction, erasure or destruction; § 2 and Part 1 Z 10 of the appendix to § 2 BMG read together with headline (emphasis by the data protection authority): Area of ​​action of the Federal Ministries § 2. (1) The scope of the Federal Ministries comprises: 1. the transactions which a) in § 3 and in part 1 of the appendix, appendix to § 2 part 1 1. [...] 9. 10. Affairs of the information about the department, including the traffic with the press, the radio and the television. § 9 MedienG reads together with headline (Emphasized by the Data Protection Authority): Counter-Statement § 9. (1) Any natural or legal person (authority) generally affected by a factual communication that has been disseminated in a periodical medium is entitled to free publication a reply in this medium, unless the reply is untrue or its publication is excluded for other reasons. (2) A factual communication accessible to a counter-disclosure shall be information which by its nature is open to verification for accuracy and completeness and whose material statement is not merely a personal expression of opinion, a judgment or a warning against the future conduct of another. (3) It should be stated briefly in the reply that, and to what extent the factual communication is incorrect or incomplete, and from which this results. The counter-notification can be made linguistically free. It must either cite the facts which, in contrast to the statement of facts, are correct or supplement the latter on a substantial point, or otherwise relate directly to the statement of facts and their incorrectness or misleading incompleteness. Its scope must not be disproportionate to the factual statement. It must be written in the language of the publication to which it refers. D.2. In the case itself: The publication of the correspondence on the website of the Respondent, as well as the corresponding link on Twitter, constitute a processing within the meaning of Art. 4 Z 2 DSGVO. As the Respondent itself correctly put forward, it is the name and the e-mail address of the complainant, as well as in the fact that communication has taken place to personal data within the meaning of Art. 4 Z 1 GDPR, as this is information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person, namely the complainant. However, the additional passages published by the Respondent constitute a personal date of the complainant, as the notion of personal data, according to ECJ case law, is not limited to sensitive or private information, but potentially more objective as well as all types of information includes subjective nature. As a prerequisite for such extensive interpretation of personal data, the ECJ notes that it must be information about the person in question. This condition is met when the information is linked to a particular person because of its content, purpose or effects (see ECJ 20.12.2017, C-434/16, paragraph 34 f.). The procedural text passages are requests of the appellant, together with corresponding detailed explanations and remarks by the Respondent and these passages in their entirety are in any case inseparable from the appellant. Therefore, this also concerns personal data according to Art. 4 Z 1 DSGVO. However, contrary to what the complainant claims, these personal data are not also to be considered as sensitive data pursuant to Art. 9 GDPR, as no political opinion can be derived from them if they are judiciously appraised. With regard to these personal data, therefore, there is also in principle a legitimate interest of the complainant in the protection of privacy pursuant to Section 1 (1) of the DSG. The existence of such an interest is, however, according to § 1 para. 1 sentence 2 leg. Cit. excluded if the data is already generally available. As stated, the complainant published a text passage on Twitter even before the Respondent published it on his website. The publication by the complainant is general availability according to § 1 Abs. 1 leg. Cit. because Twitter is a platform whose content is freely accessible and publicly available to a wide group of people. The complainant deliberately decided to publish by acting on Twitter. With regard to this passage, therefore, there is no interest of the complainant to be protected in the interests of secrecy pursuant to § 1 DSG and the appeal was to be dismissed. Subsequently, it is to be examined whether the publication of the text passages beyond this by the Respondent was legally compliant. As stated, the complainant's consent to publication is not met and was not in his vital interest. In any case, the respondent as an auxiliary apparatus of a supreme body is a "state authority" in accordance with Section 1 (2) of the DSG and publication was also carried out in the context of territorial administration. In fact, the performance of public relations tasks is inseparably linked to the activities carried out by the authorities and therefore can not be considered detached from them. After all, the purpose of public relations is to inform the public about the actions of authorities or courts. An encroachment on the constitutionally guaranteed basic right of the complainant to secrecy is therefore only permitted by law. The Respondent relies in this regard on Part 1 Z 10 of the Annex to § 2 BMG. Although this is a provision which defines the scope of the Federal Ministries in more detail, however, this does not constitute sufficient grounds for an intervention by the Respondent in the complainant's right to secrecy under Section 1 (2) of the DSG Respondent to § 9 MedienG, which in paragraph 1 leg. Cit. also gives a public authority a right of reply. However, this reply must be made in the same medium, which is not the case by publication of the procedural text passages on the website of the Federal Ministry. In addition, this reply is in accordance with paragraph 3 leg. Cit. in a concise manner and must not be disproportionate to the facts. The complainant, as stated, published a brief message on Twitter, after which the Respondent disclosed all correspondence with details of the content of all inquiries, date and time, as well as subsequent reactions and explanations. This is a "counter-notification", which in any case is disproportionate to the complainant's publication. This can not be justified by the Respondent that the full disclosure was necessary to maintain the people's trust in the Respondent, because, as just explained, § 9 MedienG allows only a brief counter-representation. Therefore, the publication by the Respondent does not comply with the requirements of a counter notification according to § 9 MedienG. Sofern der Beschwerdegegner sich auf eine Veröffentlichung aufgrund berechtigter Interessen nach Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f DSGVO stützt, so verkennt er, dass dieser gemäß Abs. 1 letzter Satz leg. cit. nicht auf Behörden in Erfüllung ihrer Aufgaben anwendbar ist. Im Ergebnis war daher keine geeignete Rechtsgrundlage für den erfolgten Eingriff des Beschwerdegegners in das verfassungsrechtlich gewährleistete Grundrecht des Beschwerdeführers auf Geheimhaltung gegeben und liegt somit eine Verletzung des § 1 DSG vor. Die vorliegende Beschwerde erwies sich bezüglich der eben erörterten Textpassagen als berechtigt und war ihr daher gemäß § 24 Abs. 5 DSG teilweise Folge zu geben und die Verletzung spruchgemäß festzustellen. D.3. Zum Mandatsbescheid: Gemäß § 22 Abs. 4 DSG kann die Datenschutzbehörde, sofern durch den Betrieb einer Datenverarbeitung eine wesentliche unmittelbare Gefährdung schutzwürdiger Geheimhaltungsinteressen der betroffenen Person (Gefahr in Verzug) vorliegt, die Weiterführung der Datenverarbeitung mit Bescheid gemäß § 57 Abs. 1 AVG untersagen. § 57 Abs. 1 AVG normiert, dass die Behörde berechtigt ist, bei Gefahr im Verzug einen Bescheid hinsichtlich unaufschiebbarer Maßnahmen auch ohne vorausgegangenes Ermittlungsverfahren zu erlassen. Wie festgestellt, wurden die Textpassagen zwischenzeitig von der Webseite des Beschwerdegegners entfernt. Gefahr im Verzug liegt demnach nicht vor. Der Antrag des Beschwerdeführers war daher abzuweisen.
