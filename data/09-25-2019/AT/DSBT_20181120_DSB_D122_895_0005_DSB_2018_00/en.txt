Legal basis: Art. 16, Art. 57 para. 1 lit. f and Article 77 (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR), OJ No. L 119, p. 1; §§ 24, 30 Abs. 4 of the Data Protection Act - DSG, BGBl. I Nr. 165/1999 idgF. EXPLANATORY STATEMENT A. Arguments of the parties and procedural By appeal of 3 April 2018 pursuant to § 31 DSG 2000, BGBl. I No. 165/1999 as amended by Federal Law Gazette I No. 83/2013, for alleged infringement of the right to rectification (§ 27 DSG 2000), the complainant stated that she was an employee of the Respondent. The tax office N *** - M *** - as the personnel office, is in charge of the service of the contract staff and all related tasks in this area - carry out an electronic personnel activity for employees. On 4 July 2017, the complainant reported to her immediate superior, Mag. P ***, in M ​​***. On 7 July 2017, the complainant, in accordance with normal practice, had inserted a copy of the sick report, enveloped in the organization's mailbox at the N *** location. Thus the complainant would have adhered to the established procedure in the event of a sick leave. This also applies to the extension of the sick leave, which was filed by the complainant on 11 July 2017 again in the same mailbox. On the same day, she had received from the Respondent a letter dated 11 July 2017, alleging that she was being charged with a breach of duty, as she had not duly certified the sick leave. In addition, the complainant had learned that the termination had been intended by the employer and that a communication had been made to the Disability Committee. The services committee had been informed of the intended dismissal by letter of 11 July 2017, but had not consented to the dismissal. By letter of 25 July 2017 was removed from the notice. The complainant had behaved in conformity with the law at all times. She had reported the sick leave duly by telephone to her supervisor before starting work. In addition, she had her sick leave also within three days in writing in the form of sick leave nachbescheinigt. There is no general obligation to certify, this must always be done only if the employer asks the employee to submit one. Although it was apparent from the electronic personnel file that a dismissal procedure would have been initiated against the appellant, which had subsequently been refrained from, in addition there were minutes of discussions, which would relate to the subject case, but the personnel act was not it can be deduced that it would have emerged, after clarification, that the complainant had not committed a breach of duty. In this regard, the complainant's representative sent a further letter to the Respondent on 22 October 2017 requesting that the circumstances surrounding the dismissal be corrected in the complainant's personal file. The Respondent would have reacted by letter of 18 December 2017, where it merely stated that all relevant legal acts and documents had been included in the complainant's personal file. Furthermore, it can not be deduced from this section of the file that the appellant is currently being charged with "wrongful conduct". It was not necessary to record the notice of termination of service by notice of termination by the employer and it was already documented that this measure had been abandoned. This letter from the Respondent did not meet the requirements of a rectification, whereupon the Appellant's representative again sent a letter for the purpose of correcting it. The Respondent's letter of 18 December 2017 merely states that, although the complainant is not currently accused of unlawful conduct, it can not be inferred from that letter that the complainant had not previously committed any unlawful conduct. The Respondent responded by letter of 31 January 2018, in which a further correction had been rejected. The complainant feels violated in her right that the personal data held about her do not correspond to the actual events, because in the electronic personnel act, in which the data of the employees would be detained, although it is clear that a notice procedure was initiated due to a breach of duty, this However, it can not be inferred that the complainant did not in fact commit a breach of duty. The complainant therefore has the right to rectify her personal data in the electronic personnel file. The eight-week period had expired (application of 22 October 2017), and the Respondent had also stated in a letter dated 31 January 2018 that it did not intend to correct the claim. It may be noted by decision violation in the right to rectification of the complainant. The Respondent replicated on 25 May 2018. The complainant was on sick leave as of 4 July 2017. She would have reported this to her supervisor over the phone, but no confirmation had been received by the line manager or supervisor until 11 July 2017. On the basis of this circumstance and with regard to the principle of non-promiscuousness enshrined in employment law, the tax office N *** - M *** informed the Committee on Employment and the Disability Committee at the Federal Social Welfare Office of Styria about the intention of the personnel office to terminate the employment relationship with the complainant , § 32 para 2 no. 1 in conjunction with. § 7 VBG in compliance with the notice period acc. § 33 VBG to terminate. On 12 July 2017, in the area of ​​the tax office N *** - M ***, an envelope with the inscription "Organization" was found containing a medical certificate of the respondent confirming incapacity for work from 4 July 2017 would have. Therefore, both the services committee and the disability committee had been informed on 25 July 2017 that the complainant's intended dismissal was being dropped. Following electronic access to the complainant's personal file, her legal representatives had requested by letter of 22 November 2017 and 18 January 2018 that they document in the personnel file that there had been no wrongdoing or breach of duty by their client. By e-mail of 18 December 2017, the complainant's respondent informed the complainant that, in the course of the conduct of a staff event, all personnel-relevant operations, together with the related documents and documents, should be recorded for each staff member. As regards the service procedures referred to the complainant's legal representatives, it was stated that they were fully recorded and documented in the electronic personnel file. In this context, the complainant's legal representatives were expressly informed that it could not be deduced from these parts of the file that their client could at present be accused of committing a breach of duty. Furthermore, this message, as well as the submissions made by the legal representatives on 22 November 2017 and 14 December 2017, respectively, were included in the complainant's electronic personnel file. By e-mail of 31 January 2018, the Respondent pointed out that, from the complainant's point of view, the facts referred to were documented in detail and in the necessary clarity in the personnel file of the said staff and no need to make additions was recognized. In its statement of 3 April 2018, the Respondent further stated that since 2009 staff files have been kept exclusively in electronic form for staff of the Federal Financial Administration. All of the facts covered by the present complaint were correct and completely recorded in the complainant's electronic personnel file. According to Grünanger / Goricnik, Employee Data Protection and Employee Control, 2014, p. 255, the digital personnel file is defined as follows: "Personnel files are a collection of documents and documented procedures that relate to the personal and professional circumstances of an employee and those in an internal context Related to the employment relationship. They should give as complete, truthful and careful an account of these circumstances as possible. "The Respondent fully complied with the quoted definition regarding the conduct of the personnel file with regard to the present complaint. By letter of 5 July 2018, the complainant stated that she remained in her current position. Furthermore, it disputes the accuracy of the respondent's statement of 25 May 2018. The wording chosen by the respondent that "it can not be deduced from the parts of the file that her client is currently being charged with breach of duty" does not constitute a correction of the facts , The coveted correction, according to which the complainant was not to be accused of breach of duty or of any other unlawful conduct with regard to the events surrounding her illness as of 4 July 2017, had not been made. Accordingly, the respondent's argument according to which the necessary facts are documented with the "necessary clarity" and therefore that there is no need to make additions goes nowhere. B. Object of the complaint According to the submission of the parties, the question arises as to whether the Respondent has infringed the complainant by not correcting the personal act in its right of rectification. C. Determination of facts The complainant is a contract agent of the Confederation and her personnel department is the Respondent. Since 2009, the Respondent has been keeping the personal files - including those of the complainant - exclusively in electronic form for the employees of the Federal Financial Administration. On 4 July 2017, the complainant reported by telephone to her supervisor sick. In addition, the complainant wrote that on 7 July 2017, in accordance with normal practice, she had a copy of the sick report and placed it in the organization's mailbox at N ***. On 11 July 2017, the tax office N *** - M *** notified the services committee and the disability committee of the Federal Social Welfare Office Styria about the intention of the employment relationship with the complainant gem. § 32 para 2 no. 1 in conjunction with. § 7 VBG in compliance with the notice period acc. § 33 VBG to terminate. By letter of 11 July 2017, the Respondent informed the Appellant that he was being charged with a breach of duty for failing to duly certify the sick leave. On 12 July 2017, the complainant found the envelope in which the complainant's medical certificate with a disability from 4 July 2017 was found. On July 25, 2017, the Respondent informed the Services Committee and the Disability Committee at the Federal Social Welfare Office of Styria that the complainant's intended dismissal was being dropped. The following relevant documents and documents are to be found in the electronic personnel file held by the Respondent in relation to this incident:  The complainant's protocol of termination by the FA N *** - M *** at the BVA public service of 11 July 2017.  The notification of the tax office N *** - M *** to the complainant about the termination of her remuneration due to a breach of duty due to unjustified absence from service (GZ BMF- * 4 * 3 * 1/0 * 2 - *** / 2017 ).  The notification in accordance with § 9 para. 1 lit. a PVG of the tax office N *** - M *** to the services committee, according to which it is intended to terminate the employment relationship with the appellant in accordance with § 32 para. 2 no. 1 in conjunction with § 7 VBG due to unjustified absence from the service under observance of the notice period.  The complainant's medical report dated 4 July 2018, received at the Tax Office N *** - M *** on 12 July 2018.  The complainant's letter of 18 July 2018 to the tax office N *** - M ** *, in which these ua demands that the accusation of breach of duty be withdrawn and that this be removed from the personnel file or deleted.  The notification pursuant to § 9 para. 1 lit. a PVG of the Board of the tax office N *** - M *** of 25 July 2017 to the services committee, according to which the complainant's intention to terminate the contract was dropped.  The letter of the complainant's lawyer of 24 October 2017, according to which the complainant would assert her right to rectify or delete data, should indeed be manifest in the personal file as a breach of duty.  Letter from the Finanzamt N *** - M *** dated 18 December 2017 to the complainant: The relevant legal acts and documents are fully recorded and documented in the complainant's personal file. It can not be inferred from these parts of the file that the appellant is accused of committing an improper conduct. Notification of termination of service by notice of termination by the employer is a procedure which, of course, has to be documented in the personnel file - as well as the fact that the employer refrained from doing so.  the complainant's letter of 18 January 2018, in which the complainant once again called on the tax office N ***-M *** to formulate the correction in such a way that it clearly and unequivocally reveals that none of the events relating to the sick leave Breach of duty or any other unlawful conduct of the complainant.  letter from the tax office N *** - M *** dated 31 January 2018 to the complainant: the facts had been clarified in detail from the point of view of the FA N *** - M *** and documented in the necessary clarity in the complainant's personal file and therefore no need for making supplements is recognized. Proof of evidence: The facts arise from the appellant's allegations of 3 April. 2018 including supplements; Arguments of the respondents of 25 May 2018 including enclosures and the appellant's arguments of 5 July 2018. D. From a legal point of view: 1. General The legal situation at the time of the decision of the DPA is decisive, unless it concerns the assessment a behavior at a given time. The object of the complaint, however, is not based on a specific key date or period. Accordingly, according to the legal position in force on May 25, 2018, the procedure previously conducted under DSG 2000, Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 (as amended by Federal Law Gazette I No. 83/2013) as appeal proceedings under § 24 DSG, Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 as amended (see § 69 (4) DSG). 2. The right to rectification and completion in accordance with. Art. 16 GDPR Art. 16 GDPR including title (emphasis added by the Data Protection Authority): Article 16 Right to rectification The data subject has the right to demand from the person responsible without delay the correction of incorrect personal data concerning him. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject has the right to request the completion of incomplete personal data, including by means of a supplementary statement. a) Art. 16 GDPR pursues the objective protection objective of (reproducing) the factual accuracy of processed personal data. Precondition for the right of rectification is the objective incorrectness of this personal data. The term "incorrectness" is an autonomous term to be interpreted under European Union law, which is not defined in the GDPR. The central measure of the incorrectness is the objective meaningfulness of the data, regardless of what they say according to the subjective view of the person responsible or affected. According to common usage, incorrect is false, untrue, inaccurate or falsifying. Data (for example in the content of a stored text document) which are within the limits of the oversized prohibition (see the consistent case law of the Data Protection Commission, such as the decision of 29 November 2005, GZ K121.046 / 0016-DSK / 2005) for the purposes of an official Are considered to be correct from the point of view of data protection law, if they formally correctly reproduce the corresponding procedural result (such as a file of another authority, a report of an administrative body, an expert opinion or the testimony of a person providing evidence). However, the content of the information (such as testimony), the value of evidence or its admissibility in the proceedings before the authority acting as controller does not apply in this context, except where otherwise provided by law. (see the decision of the Data Protection Commission of 14 June 2013, GZ DSB-K121.939 / 0010-DSK / 2013) If the purpose of the data application alone in the documentation of opinions or assessment, the data from a data protection point of view, if they reproduce this opinion or assessment correctly. (see the decision of the Data Protection Commission dated 21 March 2007, GZ K121.246 / 0008-DSK / 2007) b) Pursuant to Art. 16 sentence 2 GDPR, the data subject has the right, the completion of incomplete personal data To request data. The precondition for this is the incompleteness: Incomplete are personal data that are correct in their own right, but in their entirety make an objectively false statement or are incomplete and thus objectively ambiguous. It is important to consider the overall context, taking into account all circumstances. In doing so, consideration must be given to the specific processing purpose. The complainant's legal obligation to complete is only in those cases where the information added is actually relevant to the processing process in order to ensure the objective accuracy of the data. 3. The procedural electronic personnel act a) According to Art. 2 para. 1 DSGVO, the material scope of the GDPR extends to the automated processing of personal data as well as to the non-automated processing of personal data that is stored in a file system or is to be stored. The electronic personnel act, which represents a digital collection of data, which the employer leads over the coworker, falls in any case under the scope of the GDPR. The complainant's request was directed to correcting the information in the personnel file to the effect that the applicant was not guilty of a breach of duty. Information about the Complainant, as contained in the Respondent's personal file in the given case, is accessible to personal data within the meaning of Art. 4 no. 1 DSGVO and therefore, in principle, to a correction under Art. 16 DSGVO. The Respondent has documented in the personnel file the corresponding documents and thus formally correctly reproduced. The personnel file does not contain any data that can be qualified as false, untrue, inaccurate or falsifying. The complainant has no right to correction to the extent that information that is subjectively relevant to her is included in the documentation or that certain wording is specified by her (see the decision of the Data Protection Commission of 24 September 2010, GZ K121.608 / 00014-DSK / 2010). It can not be deduced from the documented parts of the file that the allegation of a breach of duty or otherwise of an improper conduct has been confirmed. It was only the exact process - from suspicion to the appropriate statements, after which the suspicion has not been substantiated - documented, inter alia. also that the envelope was later discovered and that then the intended dismissal was abandoned. In the present case, therefore, the prerequisite for the incorrectness of the personal data in the personnel file was missing. b) Regarding the right to completion: The question of (in) completeness is to be determined on the basis of the specific processing purpose. The added information must therefore actually be relevant to the processing process to ensure objective accuracy. Adding the information that the complainant did not behave in breach of duty is not relevant with regard to the processing purpose (documentation, personnel management), because this information already results from a synopsis of all relevant documents. The information in the personnel act is not incomplete or objectively misleading. There is thus no incompleteness of the personal data in the personnel file. It was therefore to decide according to the claim.
