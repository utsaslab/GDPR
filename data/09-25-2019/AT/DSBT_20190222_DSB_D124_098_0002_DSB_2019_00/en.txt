I No. 165/1999 as amended. EXPLANATORY STATEMENT A. Arguments of the parties and procedure 1. By submission of 25 January 2019 (registered as received on 28 January 2019), the complainant alleged an infringement of the right of access and summarized that the respondent had responded to his request for information of 10 October. December 2018, which was delivered on December 11, 2018, unresponsive. A corresponding proof of delivery is attached to the act. 2. By observations of 13 February 2019, the respondent summarized that the complainant had sent his request for information to its branch in Klagenfurt or to the staff member present there. However, in the privacy policy it is pointed out at the outset that a request for information should be sent in writing to the Data Protection Officer "Ing. Richard B ***, J *** Gasse * 4, 4 * 3 * P *** berg, b***@n***.at ". However, the data protection officer did not receive any request for information. The Respondent was willing to respond to the request for information, the complainant may submit his request to walter.c***@n***.at due to the holiday absence [leave commentator: last word added, original sentence due to editorial error incomplete] , B. Object of the complaint On the basis of the complainant's submission, the subject of the complaint is the question whether the respondent infringed the right of access by not responding to his request for information of 10 December 2018. C. Determination of facts On 10 December 2018, the complainant sent a data protection request for information to a Klagenfurt branch of the Respondent by post. This request for information was served on the Respondent on 11 December 2018. Since the Respondent did not respond to the request for information within a period of one month from notification, the complainant lodged a complaint with the Data Protection Authority. The Respondent did not respond to this request for information until the end of the proceedings before the Data Protection Authority. Assessment of evidence: The findings made are based on the complainant's submission of 25 January 2019. The Respondent confirmed in its comments of 13 February 2019 that the request for information dated 10 December 2018 had been sent to its branch in Klagenfurt. D. From a legal point of view it follows: A request for information is a one-sided declaration of intent which is subject to receipt. In order to have legal effects, the request must therefore be addressed to the person in charge (compare with the legal position under the DSG 2000 the decision of the Data Protection Commission of 24 July 2009, GZ K121.504 / 0008-DSK / 2009 mwN). In accordance with Art. 12 (3) GDPR, the person responsible must then provide the relevant information to the applicant within the regular period of one month from receipt of a request for information, or in accordance with Art. 12 para. 4 leg. Cit. to inform about the main reasons for non-action. However, what is meant by "receipt of the application" is left open to the European legislator, which is why the national legislator has to be consulted. According to the general civil law theory of reception, it is to be judged according to when an explanation reaches the sphere of influence of the recipient (see § 862a ABGB). According to this theory of reception, a declaration is deemed to have been received by the addressee if this has been brought into such a situation that the information can be expected to be received by the addressee under normal circumstances and possible disruptions are only possible in the area of ​​the addressee (see Illibauer in Knyrim [cf. Hrsg], DatKomm Art. 12 DSGVO Rz 85). In the present case, the request for information was undisputedly transmitted to a branch of the Respondent located in Klagenfurt, whereby the request for information was unquestionably within its sphere of influence. There are also no indications that would suggest the opposite (for example, a request for information, which was obviously sent to a "Noreply" address). Therefore, the regular period of one month is calculated from 11 December 2018. Furthermore, it must be pointed out that the person responsible must take appropriate measures in accordance with Art. 12 (2) GDPR in order to facilitate the exercise of the affected rights (see also recital 59) and 63 DSGVO). Insofar as the Respondent submits that, in accordance with its data protection regulations, the right to information or the request for information is sent to the Data Protection Officer "Ing. Richard B ***, J * gasse * 4, 4 * 3 * P *** berg, b***@n***.at ", it is therefore in Art. 12 para. 2 DSGVO anchored relief requirement: A data subject can not be required under privacy provisions or terms and conditions to submit an application for the exercise of data subject - in case of other invalidity - to a specific address or in a certain way. The person concerned must only ensure that the application demonstrably comes within the sphere of authority of the person responsible. The person responsible therefore has to take suitable measures within the meaning of Art. 12 (1) and (2) of the GDPR that data protection applications are forwarded to the relevant internal office for further processing, so that the standard period under Art. 3 Leg. Cit. can be complied with. In view of the time already elapsed, a period of one week is appropriate for the Respondent to provide the relevant information or to inform the complainant of the reasons for not acting in accordance with Par. 4 leg. Cit. can teach.
