Ulrich A *** (Complainant) of 23 July 2018 against N ***, Inc (Respondent), established in CA 9 * 3 * 2 T ***, USA, represented in the Union by the N *** Nederland BV, established in **** Amsterdam, The Netherlands, for breach of the fundamental right to data protection as follows: - The appeal is granted and it is determined that the Respondent has violated the applicant's fundamental right to privacy by 19 July 2018 sent an e-mail for promotional purposes, although there was no consent to this. Legal basis: Art. 5 para. 1 lit. a, c and e, Art. 27, Art. 57 para. 1 lit. and Article 77 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), OJ EPO No. L 119 of 4.5.2016, p. 1; §§ 1 (1), 24 (1) and (5) of the Data Protection Act (DSG), BGBl. I No. 165/1999 as amended; Article 8 (1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (EU-GRC), OJ. 391. EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM A. Arguments of the parties and procedure 1. By submission of 23 July 2018, the complainant alleged infringement of the right to information and the illegality of the processing of his data. In summary, on May 26, 2018, he submitted an application for information to the email address given in the privacy statement of the Respondent. However, the Respondent did not respond to this request. The application was based on an e-mail from the Respondent dated 18 May 2018. In the context of this e-mail, the Respondent informed the complainant that his consent was needed in order to remain in contact with him. However, the complainant also received an e-mail on 19 July 2018 for advertising purposes, even though he had not given his consent. The Respondent therefore uses its data unlawfully. The entry is accompanied by the request for information of 26 May 2018 and a screenshot of the e-mail of 18 May 2018 and 19 July 2018. 2. By letter of 28 November 2018, the Respondent summarized that on 6 November 2018, it had provided retrospective information to the complainant. The letter is accompanied by a copy of the e-mail of 6 November 2018. 3. The DPA granted the complainant by letter of 3 December 2018 party hearing in accordance with § 24 (6) DSG. The complainant no longer complained about the subsequently issued information of 6 November 2018, which is why the DPA informally terminated the procedure with regard to the alleged infringement in the right to information by letter of 24 January 2019. At the same time, the DPA requested the complainant to clarify his complaint with regard to the alleged unlawfulness of the processing of his data and to assert a right to have the data subject. 4. In its observations of 27 January 2019, the appellant summarized that the Respondent infringed the fundamental right to secrecy in the processing of his personal data by applying the principles of processing under Article 5 GDPR and the lawfulness of the processing according to Art. 6 DSGVO. 5. By observations of 13 February 2019, the Respondent summarized that the complainant had registered with the Respondent at the end of 2014 to attend a marketing event and provided his contact details. Prior to the application of the GDPR, the complainant had received an e-mail requesting that he give a confirmation, provided that the Respondent still wanted to receive further e-mails. The complainant had not agreed to further communication, but still received e-mails from the Respondent, but this should not have happened. In view of this, it was confirmed that the complainant was "completely removed in all future marketing communications from N ***". B. Object of the complaint On the basis of the complainant's allegation, the subject of the complaint is the question whether the Respondent infringed the applicant's fundamental right to privacy by sending an e-mail to them on advertising on 19 July 2018, although no such e-mail Consent was obtained. C. Determination of facts 1. The Respondent has its presence in CA 9 * 3 * 2 T ***, USA and is represented in the Union by N *** Nederland B.V., established in **** Amsterdam, the Netherlands. 2. The Respondent requested the complainant, who is resident in Austria, by e-mail dated 18 May 2018, to give his consent in order to remain in contact with him. 3. Although the complainant did not give his consent for further contact, the Respondent sent an e-mail to the complainant (ulrich@a***.at.) For promotional purposes (offer to attend an event event in Germany) on 19 July 2018 ). 4. By observations of 13 February 2019, the Respondent submitted that the complainant's e-mail address was "completely removed in all future marketing communications from N ***". Proof of evidence: The findings are based on the applicant's undisputed submissions of 23 July 2018, the Respondent's comments of 13 February 2019 and an official search of the Respondent's privacy policy (https: //www.n***.com /privacy-statement.html, retrieved on 6 March 2019), which is the basis of the findings of fact. D. From a legal point of view, it follows: 1. Respondent and its representative in the Union As a preliminary point, it should be noted that the "one-stop-shop" mechanism under Article 60 GDPR does not apply in the present case, as the Respondent within the meaning of Article 4 (7) DSGVO decides on the purposes and means of processing and has its seat only in the USA. The Respondent mentions N *** Nederland B.V. in its privacy policy. as its representative in the territory of the Union pursuant to Article 3 (3) in conjunction with Article 27 (1) GDPR, which, according to the data protection statement of the Respondent, has no decision-making authority with regard to the processing activity of the Respondent. Against this background, the present complaint was submitted to N *** Nederland B.V. pursuant to Art. 27 (4) GDPR. to convey. Since the appointment of a representative according to the express regulation text pursuant to Art. 27 (5) GDPR does not entail a transfer of responsibility, the present decision is directed against the Respondent by the Data Protection Authority. 2. Directive 2002/58 / EC as lex specialis In the present case, the Respondent sent an e-mail to the complainant for advertising purposes, although no such consent was obtained. It should be noted that the sending of electronic mail for advertising purposes without the prior consent of the subscriber ("Unsolicited Messages") in accordance with the provision of § 107 (1) TKG 2003 (Article 13 (1) of Directive 2002/58 / EC, the "e-Privacy Directive") is to be judged. In this respect, the legal position has not changed since the 25th of May 2018 (see Article 95 of the GDPR, according to which the Regulation confers on natural or legal persons processing in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services in public communications networks) imposes no additional obligations on the Union, insofar as they are subject to specific obligations set out in the e-Privacy Directive which pursue the same objective). However, this does not mean that the complainant is not entitled to a data protection complaint pursuant to Art. 77 (1) GDPR. Admittedly, the admissibility of contacting for advertising purposes - as explained - is governed by the provisions of the TKG 2003 and the e-Privacy Directive and not by Art. 6 GDPR. However, a breach of the TKG 2003 or the e-Privacy Directive may simultaneously result in a violation of the right to secrecy pursuant to Section 1 (1) DSG and also a violation of the provisions of the GDPR which does not impose any additional obligations within the meaning of Art. 95 DSGVO (see DSB decision of 31 October 2018, DC DSB-D123.076 / 0003-DSB / 2018). 3. Law on infringement First of all, it should be noted that although the appellant relied in its submissions on a violation of Art. 5 and Art. 6 GDPR (thus a lack of consent), the data subjects were subject to Chapter III DSGVO (Art. 12 bis 23) are listed exhaustively. According to case law of the Data Protection Authority, a data subject can still rely on any provision apart from Chapter III of the GDPR, as far as this can result in a possible violation of the right to secrecy under § 1 (1) DSG (see the decision the DSB of 13 September 2018, DSB-D123.070 / 0005-DSB / 2018, according to which a violation of the responsible person against Art. 32 DSGVO can lead to a violation of § 1 Abs. 1 DSG). Accordingly, an infringement of the right to secrecy was to be checked, which - as stated - is not covered by Art. 95 DSGVO. 4. The right to secrecy in international matters a) The territorial scope of the GDPR The procedural e-mail address consists of the First and last name of the complainant, which is why a personal reference is given. In addition, while the Respondent is not established in the Union, the processing of the complainant's data, which is resident in Austria, is linked to the offering of goods or services (objective: offer to attend an event in Germany); why the GDPR in accordance with Art. 3 para. 2 lit. a DSGVO is spatially applicable (see recital 23 GDPR, according to which the use of the language of a data subject, together with the possibility of ordering goods and services in that language, indicates that the person responsible intended to be a person in the Union or to provide services). b) The fundamental right to data protection and the horizontal effect of Article 8 (1) EU-GRC According to the Data Protection Authority, the GDPR is generally a fundamental right to data protection and the DSGVO - the most important European secondary law source for the handling of personal data - is in one close relationship with Article 8 (1) of the EU-GRC and serves to further elaborate it. This is already clear from recital 1 of the GDPR, according to which "the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data [...] is a fundamental right". According to Article 8 (1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union [...], every person has the right to the protection of personal data concerning them. "Against this background, the Data Protection Authority assumes that the right of appeal under Article 77 (1) GDPR, in addition to the assertion of the infringement of data subjects according to Chapter III of the Ordinance - also in the case of international matters, a possibility of appeal based on § 1 para. 1 DSG in conjunction with Art. 8 para. 1 EU-GRC opened. Based on these considerations and on the fact that the GDPR also directly obliges those responsible in the private (ie non-sovereign) sector, the DPA takes the view that the fundamental right to data protection under Article 8 (1) of the EU-GRC also applies as § 1 DSG horizontal effect. In other words, as the GDPR is inherent in a general fundamental right to data protection, which is expressly enshrined in Article 8 (1) EU-GRC, a data subject can also, in the result, appeal against legal entities established in private-law forms under Article 77 (1) of the GDPR and based that complaint on an infringement of Article 8 (1) EU-GRC (see the judgment of the ECJ of 29 November 2017, C-214/16, paragraphs 31 et seq the ECJ does not expressly deny such a horizontal effect of rights under the EU-GRC, which is more clearly expressed in the Opinion of the Advocate General in this case, which expressly supports a horizontal effect of EU-GRC provisions). An alleged breach of the principles under Articles 5 and 6 GDPR can therefore be invoked as an alleged violation of Article 8 EU-GRC. 5. The lawfulness of the processing As stated above, the lawfulness of the processing is governed exclusively by the e-Privacy Directive as lex specialis. According to Article 13 (1) of the e-Privacy Directive, prior consent must be given to the data subject before electronic mail is sent. It should be noted, however, that the ePrivacy Directive does not provide for any specific terms or definition of consent. However, with regard to the concept of "consent", the e-Privacy Directive refers to the consent within the meaning of Directive 95/46 / EC (Data Protection Directive, see Art. 2 (f) of the Data Protection Directive). The concept of consent under the e-Privacy Directive therefore corresponds in a systematic interpretation to the concept of consent under Article 4 (11) or Article 7 GDPR, as is apparent from Article 94 (2) GDPR. Therefore, the processing can not be based on an alternative permission requirement according to Art. 6 GDPR (for example legitimate interests according to para. 1 lit. f leg. Cit.), Which the Respondent did not claim. However, as stated, there was no consent for the receipt of e-mails for advertising purposes, the personal data of the complainant (his e-mail address with real name) were processed unlawfully (ie without a license), which is a violation of § 1 Abs 1 DSG in conjunction with Article 8 (1) EU-GRC. Since the complainant - despite the Respondent's request by e-mail of 18 May 2018 - no longer gave such consent, the Respondent would have been obliged to delete the complainant's e-mail address; However, it should be noted that this obligation does not first result from the GDPR, but has already existed according to the old legal position in accordance with the Data Protection Directive. Since the respondent stated on 13 February 2019 that the complainant's e-mail address had been "completely removed from all future marketing communications from N ***", there was no performance mandate pursuant to § 24 (5) DSG or Art. 58 para. 2 lit. c DSGVO. It was therefore appropriate to decide.
