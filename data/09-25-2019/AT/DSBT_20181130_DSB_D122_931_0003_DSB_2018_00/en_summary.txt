The right to secrecy a) The right to appeal The DPA has already stated that the data subjects are listed exhaustively in Chapter III of the GDPR (Articles 12 to 23) to become an affected person in the context of a complaint procedure, however, to any provision of the GDPR, as far as this may result in a possible violation of the right to secrecy under ยง 1 paragraph 1 DSG (see DSB of 13 September 2018, DSB-D123.070 / 0005 -DSB / 2018, according to which a breach by the controller of Article 32 may lead to a breach of Section 1 (1) of the DSG (see DSB 31 October 2018, DSB-D123.076 / 0003-DSB / 2018) a complaint is possible based on Art. In the present case, it should first be noted that the Respondent in variant 1 (consent to the use of the webpage) does not set cookies until the visitor to the web page has made a conscious decision, ie has given consent, if he wishes to make use of variant 1 , By linking in the window ("pop-up") to the privacy policy and by a list of cookies in use ("cookies attachment"), the Respondent also in ยง 96 paragraph 3 TKG 2003 iVm Art. Likewise, according to the case-law of the DPA, it should be borne in mind that voluntary consent may be given if a particular processing operation is also for the benefit of the person concerned (see instead of many DSK dated 8 March 2006, DSK 8.3.2006, K178.209 / 0006-DSK / 2006, see also Kotschy in Brodil (ed), Data Protection in Labor Law (2010) 3). In the present case, however, this question is unnecessary, since the Respondent has implemented a way to revoke the cookie "google_pub_config" even before the end of the procedure, as well as the possibility (in the form of a button in the privacy policy, in the window or "pop-up" is made available) to revoke the consent in full (see ยง 24 para 6 DSG).
