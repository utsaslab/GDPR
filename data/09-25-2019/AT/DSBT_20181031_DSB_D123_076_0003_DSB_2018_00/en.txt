The appeal is granted and it is determined that a) the Respondent breached the complainant's right to confidentiality by using his mobile number for advertising purposes; and b) the Respondent relinquishes its duty to inform Art. 14 para. 1 and para. 2 lit. a to e and g DSGVO injured. 2. The Respondent is instructed to issue a complete communication pursuant to Art. 14 DSGVO within a period of four weeks in the case of other execution with regard to information that has not already been brought to the attention of the Complainant in the context of this procedure. Legal basis: §§ 1 (1) and (2), 24 (1) and (5) of the Data Protection Act (DSG), BGBl. I No. 165/1999 as amended; Art. 14, Art. 57 para. 1 lit. f, Art. 58 para. 2 lit. c and Article 77 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), OJ EPO 1. Statement of reasons and arguments 1. By submission of 20 June 2018 (registered as received on 25 June 2018), the complainant alleged infringement of Article 5, Art. 7, Art. 13 and Art. 14 GDPR and submitted that the Respondent contacted them by phone on 20 June 2018 in order to sell a water cooler. When asked by the complainant where the respondent had his mobile number, he had received no information. 2. By observations of 30 July 2018, the Respondent summarized that on 20 June 2018 a telephone conversation between her and the complainant had actually taken place. However, there would be no breach of the principles governing the processing of personal data or a breach of the information requirements. The focus would be on wholesale and contracting with companies or organizations. The Respondent had called the telephone number made available on the website of the National Association of the "**** Psychological Relief Association" (http://www.****hv.at). This number is not related to any particular or identifiable natural person. The number is a date that does not refer to a natural person but to an organization. However, only natural persons could be affected in the sense of DSGVO as well as the DSG. Even if the complainant were a data subject, there would be no infringement, since the mere selection of the number published on the website does not trigger an obligation to inform under Art. 14 GDPR. Although the telephone number of the organization "**** Psychologische Hilfsverband" was collected on the website of the organization, it was neither stored nor passed on, nor used in any other way. The fact that in a one-time telephone call the caller would first have to be communicated a lot of information, all of which would not be relevant to start the actual conversation, would exceed the requirements of the GDPR by far. The Respondent moreover duly identified her business and the purpose of the call. 3. In its opinion of 9 August 2018, the complainant replied that the mobile number given on the website was a possibility of calling or contacting the person concerned for advice. The website also states that this is a website for people with mental health problems. Telephone advertising is prohibited in Austria. Furthermore, the Respondent claimed that the complainant already had a product of hers, which would not be true. B. Object of the complaint On the basis of the appellant's submission, the subject of the complaint is the question whether the Respondent breached the complainant's right to confidentiality by using his mobile number for advertising purposes. In addition, the question arises as to whether the Respondent has violated its obligation to provide information by providing the complainant with no (complete) information during this telephone contact. C. Determination of facts 1. The Respondent made a mobile phone number on the website of the National Association of the "**** Psychological Relief Association", http: //www.****hv.at/. 2. The URL http://www.****hv.at/ is structured in part as follows (formatting not reproduced 1: 1): [Note editor: The part of the website of the *** reproduced here in the original as a facsimile. * HV can not be reproduced pseudonymised at a reasonable cost for purposes of legal documentation. In summary, it is the website of a non-profit organization that provides help to people with mental health problems, mental health and psychosocial problems. The complainant appears there with photo as "chairman" and contact person.] 3. If one clicks on the link next to the picture of the complainant "read on here", one arrives at the profile of the complainant with the URL http: // www . **** hv.at/****.html. This is excerpted as follows (formatting not reproduced 1: 1): [Editor's note: The part of the website of the **** HV reproduced here as a facsimile can not be reproduced pseudonymised at a reasonable cost for purposes of legal documentation. In summary, this is a self-description with photo, stating a general email address of the **** HV and a mobile number of the complainant.] Proof of evidence: The findings made are based on the complainant's unquestionable submission of 20 June 2018, to the Respondent's statement of 30 July 2018 and to a retrieval of the URLS http: //www.****hv.at/ and http: //www.****hv.at/****. html on 31 October 2018. 4. The Respondent contacted the complainant by telephone without the consent to sell or offer their products. The complainant requested in the course of the telephone conversation, the information from which source the Respondent has this mobile number. The Respondent did not share this information. Assessment of evidence: The findings are based on the complainant's submission of 20 June 2018. The respondents also did not dispute this in their comments of 30 July 2018, merely mentioning that information about "our company and the purpose of the call "- so just not from which source the mobile number was obtained - would be called. D. From a legal point of view, it follows: D. 1 On the competence of the Data Protection Authority First, it should be noted that calls for advertising purposes without the prior consent of the subscriber ("Unsolicited News") pursuant to Section 107 (1) TKG 2003 (Art. 13 of Directive 2002/58 / EC) and that a corresponding administrative penalty pursuant to Section 109 (4) (8) TKG 2003 may have to be imposed by the competent telecommunications authority. In this respect, the legal position has not changed since the 25th of May 2018 (see Article 95 of the GDPR, according to which the Regulation confers on natural or legal persons processing in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services in public communications networks) imposes no additional obligations on the Union, insofar as they are subject to specific obligations laid down in Directive 2002/58 / EC pursuing the same objective). However, this does not mean that the complainant is not entitled to a data protection complaint pursuant to Section 24 (1) DSG or Article 77 (1) GDPR. Although the admissibility of the call for advertising purposes is - as stated - according to the provisions of the TKG 2003, insofar as an assessment of the lawfulness of the processing within the meaning of Art. 6 GDPR is excluded. However, an infringement of the TKG 2003 may very well result in an infringement of the right to secrecy pursuant to Section 1 (1) DSG and also a violation of the provisions of the GDPR, which do not impose any additional obligations within the meaning of Art. 95 DSGVO. D. 2 Infringement of the right to secrecy a) Personal date As stated by the Respondent herself, the mobile number was collected on the website of the National Association of the "**** Psychological Relief Association" (**** HV) and then used to address this to contact. If the Respondent submits that, in her view, this is not a personal date for the complainant, but merely intended to conclude a contract with the SNB, it must be countered that it is precisely not the intention of the person responsible arrives, to use data in a certain way. Nor does § 1 paragraph 1 of the DSG on a fault of the person responsible from. Rather, with regard to the question of whether there is a personal date, it must be determined whether identification is possible with a justifiable and legally permissible effort (see the judgment of the ECJ of 19 October 2016, C-582/14, paragraph 43 ff). In the present case, the complainant's "profile" can be found below the given telephone number on the URL http: //www.****hv.at/. It can be seen on the complainant's profile with the URL http://www.****hv.at/****.html that this is the complainant's mobile number and, as a result, a personal date ( "Walter A *** - Mobile 06 ** / 1 * 2 * 3 ** 45"). The fact that this mobile number apparently also serves needy people as a "consultation number" does not hurt. b) In the case In the present case, it should first be noted that although the appellant relied on a violation of Art. 5 and Art. 7 GDPR (thus a lack of consent), the data subjects' rights were governed by Chapter III DSGVO (Art. 12 bis 23) are listed exhaustively. According to case-law of the Data Protection Authority, a data subject can still rely on any provision of the GDPR, as far as this can result in a possible violation of the right to secrecy under § 1 (1) DSG (see DSB of 13 September 2018 , DSB-D123.070 / 0005-DSB / 2018, according to which a breach by the controller of Article 32 may result in a violation of § 1 (1) DSG). Accordingly, an infringement of the right to secrecy was to be examined, which - as stated - is not covered by Art. 95 GDPR. The Respondent submits that the complainant (as chairman of the **** HV) has already published the mobile number on the website. However, she overlooks the fact that the mobile number has just not been made widely available to receive calls for promotional purposes. Rather, the mobile number serves as a "counseling number" for needy persons and should not just be used contrary to the purpose (for advertising measures). The general acceptance by the Respondent of the non-infringement of legitimate confidentiality interests for permissible published data is incompatible with the provisions of the GDPR (see Jahnel, Handbuch Datenschutzrecht [2010] marginal 4/27, but still in relation to § 8 sec ). This view is also in accordance with the requirements of § 107 (1) TKG 2003, according to which a mobile number provided on a homepage for consulting purposes is not sufficient as a legal basis for the performance of advertising purposes, but expressly a consent of the participant (or. in the data protection terminology: the person concerned) is required. As a result, it should be noted that the Respondent improperly used the complainant's provided mobile number for advertising, which led to a breach of confidentiality. D. 3 Infringement of the duty to provide information a) Article 14 as subjective law As already stated, the data subjects are listed exhaustively in Chapter III DSGVO (Articles 12 to 23). It is true that the provision in Article 14 (Duty to provide information where the personal data were not collected from the data subject) is not mentioned in Article 12 (2), which merely states that the data controller is to exercise his rights under Articles 15 to 22 of the Regulation (and not Article 14). However, the European legislator has decided to regulate the obligation to inform under Article 14 GDPR in Chapter III of the Regulation and not in Chapter VI, which regulates the duties of the controller and the processor. It is already clear from the title of Chapter III ('Rights of the data subject') that although, according to Article 14, it is the duty of the person responsible to provide certain information, it also constitutes a right of the person concerned, to get this information too. The fact that Article 14 does not appear to be mentioned in Article 12 (2) GDPR can only be understood as meaning that the person responsible - unlike the right to information or cancellation - does not act at the request of a data subject (see Article 12 (3) which states that 'information must be provided on the measures taken pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 without delay'), but that the information obligation of the person responsible must be fulfilled irrespective of the request. Against this background, a breach of the duty to provide information - such as a violation of Art. 32 DSGVO (see DSB of 13 September 2018 supra) - must be subsumed under § 1 (1) DSG, but can be directly based on the GDPR be claimed as a subjective right. b) In the case In the present case, the complainant's personal data (mobile number) was not collected from the complainant. Subsequently, the mobile number was used to contact the complainant for advertising purposes. Against this background, the Respondent was obliged to provide information pursuant to Art. 14 GDPR. In substance, the Respondent first refused to inform the complainant explicitly in the context of telephone contact that the information concerning the source was required (which, as stated, may be required as a subjective right). This information was subsequently granted as part of the procedure before the Data Protection Authority. In addition, the Respondent also violated Art. 14 para. 3 lit. b of the Ordinance, according to which further information pursuant to Art. 14 GDPR must also be made available to the complainant at the time of the first notification. Even if the telephone contact is not understood as a communication and thus Art. 14 para. 3 lit. If the DSGVO is used, the Respondent should have provided the relevant information no later than one month after the data was collected. As a result, there was also a violation of the duty to inform under Art. 14 GDPR. A period of four weeks seems appropriate to fill in the missing information according to Art. 14 para. 1 and para. 2 lit. a to e and g DSGVO (see Article 14 (5) (a) DSGVO). It was therefore appropriate to decide.
