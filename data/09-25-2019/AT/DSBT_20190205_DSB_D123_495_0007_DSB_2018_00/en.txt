The appeal is dismissed. Legal basis: § 1 (1) and (3), § 4 (1), § 24 (1), § 24 (6) Data Protection Act - DSG, BGBl. 165/1999 as amended, Art. 6 (1) lit. d), Art. 6 para. 4, Art. 17 para. 1 lit. b) General Data Protection Regulation - DSGVO L 119, p.1. EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM A. Arguments of the parties and procedure 1.) By submitting an inducement of 17 September 2018, the applicant alleged an infringement of the fundamental right to data protection. It stated that the Respondent sent him a mailing with a catalog on 1 September 2018 and an advertising mail on 6 September 2018, even though he requested that his data be deleted from the Respondent by e-mail of 1 June 2018 have. 2.) By resolution of 28 September 2018, DP: DSB-D123.495 / 0001-DSB / 2018, the DPA requested the Respondent to comment on the complainant's allegations. 3.) By submission of 25 October 2018, the Respondent commented on behalf of its designated representative: It is true that the Respondent sent an e-mail in early June 2018 concerning the General Data Protection Regulation and that the complainant's e-mail address had been answered. By letter dated 12 June 2018, the Respondent stated that it needed proof of identity to identify the complainant. Thereafter, they have received the complaint before the data protection authority. The Respondent must provide for the identification necessary for the exercise of the very personal right of deletion and in another way the identity can not be determined. The complaint was therefore premature or unjustified. Irrespective of this, a right to erase is only eligible if there is no reason to process it or if it subsequently ceases to exist. These conditions were not met in the case of the complainant, since a separate storage obligation, which would result from the Federal Tax Code, would be, especially since the last settlement date from the end of 2017. Nevertheless, the Respondent restricted the processing of the data and identified it so that processing could not exceed the required level. That fact was also communicated to the complainant by letter of 24 October 2018. 4.) With completion of 12 November 2018, DS: DSB-D123.495 / 0006-DSB / 2018, the DPA granted the complainant party hearing. 5.) By submission of 26 November 2018, the complainant submitted comments stating that he had not received the letter calling for clear identification. In addition, it was not understandable why this letter was not sent registered, or in parallel via e-mail. In addition, it was very interesting that by means of informal e-mail was asked whether a deletion would be desired, but nothing about the further procedure will be communicated. The complainant could well understand that not all data had to be deleted, but he had never consented to the processing of the data for advertising purposes. B. Object of the complaint The subject of the complaint is the question of whether the data are wrongly used for advertising purposes. C. Facts of the facts The complainant contacted her by letter of 8 November 2017 for a language stay in Edinburgh. The Respondent organized the language stay between April 5, 2018 and April 12, 2018. There was no consent to data processing for advertising purposes. On 1 June 2018, the Respondent requested authorization to process data for advertising purposes in connection with the entry into force of the General Data Protection Regulation. The complainant requested by e-mail of 1 June 2018 the deletion of his data. The Respondent requested by letter dated 12 June 2018 to identify the complainant as proof of identity in order to comply with the request for cancellation. Whether the letter was received by the complainant could not be ascertained. The complainant did not respond to the respondent's message. The Respondent sent a mailing with a catalog on 1 September 2018 and an advertising mail to the complainant on 6 September 2018. On 17 September 2018, the complainant lodged a complaint with the Data Protection Authority concerning the violation of the fundamental right to data protection in accordance with § 1 Data Protection Act - DSG. During the proceedings before the DPA, the Respondent informed the complainant by registered letter of 24 October 2018 that the data would no longer be used for advertising purposes. The data will continue to be processed for the purpose of retention. Proof of evidence: The finding concerning the consent to the processing of data is based on the correct and authentic document on the enrollment for the language study - provided by the complainant. The finding concerning the consent to data processing consent is based on the consistent submissions and evidence of the two parties. The finding concerning the letter of identification is based on the submissions of the respondent, which provided the underlying letter of 12 June 2018 in the proceedings. The complainant denied the service, but received according to their own information and proven service equal addressed shipments. However, since the letter was sent without proof of delivery, it can not be determined whether the service actually took place at the time. The remaining findings are undisputed and are based on the unanimous submissions of the complaint parties. D. From a legal point of view: The alleged right: In the introductory submission, the appellant, without specifying this further, refers to the fundamental right to data protection as an infringed law and claims that he received unwanted advertising. The Respondent received a request in which he stated that the Respondent deleted his data. Later in the case, with the entry of 26 November 2018, the Respondent states that he was satisfied with a partial "deletion" by stating that he understood that not all data could be deleted because of special retention periods. According to the VwGH, party declarations (including affixing [Walter / Kolonovits / Muzak / Stöger9 Rz 152]) in the proceedings must be interpreted exclusively according to their objective explanatory value (see also VwGH 6. 11. 2006, 2006/09/0094; m.w.N.). It is decisive how the declaration (see VwGH 28. 7. 2000, 94/09/0308 uA) must be objectively understood taking into account the specific legal regulation, the purpose of the procedure and the file situation (VwGH 24. 1. 1994, 93/10 / 0192, 6. 11. 2001, 97/18/0160, 19. 1. 2011, 2009/08/0058, see also VfSlg 17.082 / 2003). If an attachment has an indistinct content, then according to the Rsp of the VwGH the authority has to establish the true will of the intervener (VwGH 20. 2. 1998, 96/15/0127 , 28. 7. 2000, 94/09/0308, 19. 1. 2011, 2009/08/0058), so requesting a clarification (VwGH 26. 2. 1991, 90/04/0277; 19. 11. 1998, 98/19/0132; 3. 10. 2013, 2012/06/0185; VfSlg 14.965 / 1997) and / or content (VwGH 30. 4. 1999, 95/21/0931, 30. 6. 2004, 2004 / 04/0014; 28. 6. 2010, 2008/10/0002; Schopf, Recht 191, see also Wessely, Eckpunkte 208 f). It could be assumed objectively that, even if the complainant did not expressly designate this, he - although he subsumed his submission under § 1 DSG and not under the data protection deletion according to Art. 17 GDPR - primarily a "partial" deletion of his personal data wish. He stated that he was concerned with the processing for advertising purposes and not that the Respondent - may have other legitimate interests in the further processing of the data. Accordingly, the procedure could be continued without an order for improvement. On the possibility of finding an infringement: According to the jurisprudence of the Data Protection Authority on § 1 (3) and § 4 (1) of the DSG, the implementing norms of Art. 2 Data Protection Act on Art. 1 Data Protection Act are to be regarded as the statutory provisions of the Basic Data Protection Regulation , Accordingly, the standards of the General Data Protection Regulation are relevant for the assertion of the subjective infringement in the fundamental right to data protection in accordance with § 1 DSG, in this case Art. 17 (1) lit. d) GDPR. The complainant has demonstrated that he has never given consent to data processing for advertising purposes. However, it is also out of dispute that the Respondent lawfully identified and processed the data for conducting the language study trip to Edinburgh. Subsequently, the Respondent used the data for advertising purposes and sent a mailing with a catalog on 1 September 2018 and an advertising mail on 6 September 2018 to the complainant. The data were therefore without consent in the sense of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) DSGVO used for a purpose other than originally intended and is not covered by any other justification for processing for advertising purposes. The Respondent should therefore have assumed that it needed a (non-existent) consent for the processing. In the further proceedings, the Respondent stated in a note dated 24 October 2018 that the data was blocked for advertising purposes by means of a processing note and restricted to the purposes of the original - undisputed - lawful data processing. Although, as stated earlier, the complainant alleged an infringement of the right to erasure and a note which does not use the data for processing for a specific purpose (advertising) is in principle not a deletion within the meaning of Art. 17 GDPR (cf. Ehmann / Selmayr Datenschutzgrundverordnung2, Kamann / Braun on Art. 17, para. 35), the appellant is in the present case as if actually deleted: Since the address data of the complainant continues to be legitimate interest or legitimate by law A physical deletion is not considered, but must be ensured that the processing for the purpose of sending advertising is no longer possible. The Respondent has made a note. In its case-law, the Data Protection Authority assumes that, in the case of infringement of the right to erasure, it must continue to exist until the first instance proceedings have ended. Paragraph 24 (6) of the DSG standardizes the possibility of terminating the proceedings if the consequences of the infringement are eliminated during the procedure. A determination of past infringement in the right to erasure is out of the question (see DSB, B 27.08.2014, DSB-D121.876 / 0005-DSB / 2014). The DPA has stated that if the complaint is upheld, the application must be dismissed. (Gantschacher / Jelinek / Schmidl / Spanberger, Data Protection Act, Suda on § 24 16 ff.). By setting the note, the appellant is treated as if the appellant's application had already been originally followed. The complaint was dismissed in accordance with the claim.
