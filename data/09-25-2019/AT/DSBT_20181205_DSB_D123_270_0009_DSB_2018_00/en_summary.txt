Therefore, the responsible person has to be considered in terms of means - thus the way of erasure - (see again Kamann / Braun supra, paragraph 36, which refers to the destruction of codes or other decryption facilities without the elimination of the data itself; see also in this sense also autumn in cooling / Buchner (eds), data protection basic regulation [2017] kind 17 Rz 38, after which on the impossibility it is put away, which before in the data to be deleted perceived information to take also see also Nolte / Worker in Gola (ed), Basic Data Protection Regulation [2017], which means deletion of any kind of obfuscation of stored personal data, see also Warter, Dako 2/2018, 39 [40], according to which the result of the deletion act is authoritative ). From this it is clear that a cancellation does not necessarily require a final destruction (see the decision of the former DSK of 26 September 2008, GZ K121.375 / 0012-DSK / 2008, or in relation to Article 2 (b) of Directive 95) / 46 / EC, according to which a distinction has also been made between extinction and destruction, see also Kamann / Braun in Ehmann / Selmayr (ed), Basic Data Protection Regulation [2017] Art. GZ: DSB-D123.270 / 0009-DSB / 2018 dated 5.12.2018 [Note editors: names and companies, legal forms and product names, addresses (including URLs, IP and e-mail addresses), file numbers (and the like) , etc., as well as their initials and abbreviations can be abbreviated and / or changed for reasons of pseudonymisation. The Respondent also explained the "anonymisation process" comprehensibly with its comments of 3 October 2018 and the supplementary statement of 16 November 2018, so that there are no indications - and otherwise the complainant did not submit - that a personal reference continues to be given The reestablishment of the personal reference is possible without disproportionate effort: For example, it is apparent from these statements, which were based on the findings of fact, that the complainant's personal data were replaced by a "dummy customer".
