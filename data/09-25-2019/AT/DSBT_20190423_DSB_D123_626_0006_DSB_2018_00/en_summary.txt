GZ: DSB-D123.626 / 0006-DSB / 2018 dated April 23, 2019 [Note editors: names and companies, legal forms and product names, addresses (including URLs, IP and e-mail addresses), file numbers (and the like) , etc., as well as their initials and abbreviations can be abbreviated and / or changed for reasons of pseudonymisation. 6, 9 or 10 GDPR (cf the legal position according to DSG 2000 Kotschy in Jahnel (eds), Data Protection Law and E-Government Yearbook 2012, 27 [47], according to which by a combination of publicly available data with other data, the permissibility of their use is to be completely re-examined). Overall, therefore, the DPA concludes that, due to the balance of interests involved, there is no breach of secrecy as the respondent's legitimate interests as real estate trustee outweigh the prejudice to the complainant's legitimate interests (ยง 1 (2) DSG).
