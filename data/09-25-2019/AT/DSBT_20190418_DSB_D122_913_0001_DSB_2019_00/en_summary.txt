The data subject shall have the right to ask the person responsible for confirmation of: personal data concerning them are processed; if this is the case, it has a right to information about such personal data and to the following information: a) the processing purposes; b) the categories of personal data being processed; (c) the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or are being disclosed, in particular in the case of beneficiaries in third countries or international organizations; (d) if possible, the planned duration for which the personal data are stored or, if this is not possible, the criteria for determining that duration; (e) the existence of a right to rectification or erasure of the personal data concerning him or of a limitation of the processing or a right to object to such processing by the controller; (f) the existence of a right of appeal to a supervisory authority; g) if the personal data are not collected from the data subject, all available information on the source of the data; (h) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, as referred to in Article 22 (1) and (4) and, at least in such cases, meaningful information about the logic involved and the scope and intended impact of such processing on the data subject.
