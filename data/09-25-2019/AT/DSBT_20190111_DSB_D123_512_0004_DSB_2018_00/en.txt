Legal basis: § 1 para. 1, § 24 para. 2 of the Data Protection Act (DSG), Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 as amended; Art. 15 General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR, OJ L 119, p. 1; §§ 3 and 4 Federal Act on the Service Contract of the Caretaker (Hausbesorgergesetz), BGBl. Nr. 16/1970 idgF; EXPLANATORY STATEMENT A. Arguments of the parties and procedural background In his procedural submission of 17 September 2018, the complainant alleged that the respondent had infringed his right to information by refusing to respond to his request pursuant to Paragraph 44 of the DSG of 17 July 2018. He had submitted the request for information directly to the Respondent. In a further submission of 17 September 2018, the complainant used the same form for data protection as the DPA for an infringement pursuant to § 1 DSG. The complainant stated that he had submitted the request for information to "the vicarious agent Hausbesorger U ***" and that his identity had thus been clarified. In a third submission dated 17 September 2018, the complainant once again sent his request for information to the Respondent pursuant to Section 44 DSG and again stated on the complaint form for infringements pursuant to Section 1 DSG that the Respondent had violated his right to information. In a fourth submission dated 17 September 2018, the complainant once again sent his request for information to the Respondent in accordance with Section 44 DSG and once again stated on the complaint form for infringements pursuant to Section 1 DSG that the Respondent had violated his right to information. With clearance GZ: DSB-D123.512 / 0001-DSB / 2018 of 26 September 2018, the DPA requested the Respondent to comment and enclosed the complainant's cumulative submissions to the Opinion. By submission of 5 October 2018, the complainant reiterated his previous submissions of 17 September 2018 and added a further request for information under Art. 15 GDPR to the Respondent of 2 July 2018. The complainant in turn stated that he had submitted the request for information to "the vicarious agent Hausbesorger U ***". With entry from October 15, 2018, ho. Received on 16 October 2018, the Respondent commented that the DS: DSB-D123.189 / 0003-DSB / 2018 had filed a complaint with the same parties to the proceedings for alleged infringement of the right of access. Furthermore, it is stated that the Respondent did not receive the procedural request for information according to § 44 DSG. As regards the service of documents, it is stated that the reply to requests for information falls within the sphere of territorial administration and that the relevant literature, unlike the non-applicable rules of civil law, does not require notification to the competent institutions and, accordingly, notification by transfer to auxiliary institutions ( Eg: entry point) is allowed, but a transfer of input to the private address of employees is not included. Even if an employee of the Respondent has a place of employment, this is not a pity. Moreover, even if the appellant's petition had been received, the request for the application of the third main section of the DSG had to be rejected in the absence of the conditions for the respondent. With Completion DC: DSB-D123.512 / 0003-DSB / 2018, dated 16 November 2018, the DPA granted the complainant party hearing. By submission of 28 November 2018, the complainant stated that the caretakers were to be regarded as vicarious agents and that he considered the service to the respondent "legally received". The respondent on her website (information regarding carers) even so. Also, the "EU-compliant mailboxes" would be the property of the Respondent. There is no answer to the request for information so far. Incidentally, it is requested that the form be deemed to be correct by itself. B. Object of appeal The subject of the complaint is thus the question of whether the Respondent infringed on the complainant in the right to information. C. Findings of the facts On 16 July 2018, the complainant threw the completed form of the data protection authority, which was requested to inform the Respondent pursuant to § 44 DSG, into the caretaker of the residential building at T *** Strasse ** 17 in its mailbox. The caretaker has at the local address on a service apartment on which their private home address is. Proof of evidence: Evidence was collected through the submissions of the parties. The facts are not in dispute. The complainant has not contested the execution of the Respondent in the course of the proceedings that the Respondent did not receive the request for information. He led, on Vorhaltung by the data protection authority only from that he considered by throwing into the mailbox of the official residence of the caretaker his request as delivered. D. From a legal point of view, it follows: Concerning the subject-matter of the proceedings: It emerges from the submissions of the complainant that he wishes to find that the respondent had violated his right to information. The complaint to the data protection authority was summarized by the complainant in his first entry, which forms the subject matter of the procedure, under § 1 DSG: for party submissions not only the wording of the complaint but also the will of the party is considerable. The existence of conditions must not be interpreted in a strictly formal way, provided that the subject-matter of the proceedings - even if interpreted in the light of the arguments set out in §§ 6 u. 7 ABGB - unquestionably, thus without possibility of a confusion to recognize (VwGH 13.11.2014, Ra 2014/12/0010). Since it follows from the proceedings and from the request addressed to the Respondent that the complainant wishes to establish the breach of the right of access pursuant to Art. 15 GDPR, the wrong name of the right in the letterhead alone was irrelevant, as the will is clearly apparent. Regarding service: The complainant believes that he has already made his request for information effective by dropping it in the mailbox of the caretaker's official residence as a "vicarious agent" of the Respondent. In the result is not to follow: The complainant alleges a violation in the right to information, without having made a request for information forming the subject of the action effective. The request for information has never reached the Respondent. The complainant has not contested the execution of the Respondent in the course of the proceedings that the Respondent did not receive the request for information. He merely stated, on the basis of the data protection authority, that he considered the service as "legally lawful" because he threw it into the caretaker's mailbox. As a result, the complainant believes that his attachment was already in the scope of the Respondent, because he threw it in the mailbox of the official residence of the caretaker. There is no reason to assume that the tasks of caretakers (determined in accordance with §§ 3 and 4 Hausbesorgergesetz) would also include the receipt and forwarding of documents. The mere fact that there is a service contract between the caregiver and the Respondent whose reciprocal duties are by no means directed to the performance of this type of task does not mean that a document came within the scope of the Respondent's disposition. A responsible person (the Respondent) has to provide the possibility of a transparent communication and to inform about it according to Art. 12 DSGVO. For this purpose, the Respondent also provides on its website a contact form for data protection-related submissions - in addition to the general mailbox. The complainant did not use the available contact possibilities. Art. 15 DSGVO is conceptually a law requiring a claim and requires a limine a request received by the designated respondent. After the hg. Case law on recoverable or irrecoverable defects must be distinguished as to whether the circumstance to be proved is missing at the relevant time (this is an unrecoverable defect) or if there is a lack of evidence of the already existing circumstance (in the latter case the defect can be remedied; the ed. B of 11 November 2015, Ra 2015/04/0077, mwN). Since the data protection request for information never reached the designated Respondent, the complainant lacks the legitimacy in relation to the alleged facts at the time the complaint was lodged. The complaint concerning the alleged infringement of the right to information had to be dismissed.
