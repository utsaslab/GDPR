Obvious spelling, grammatical and punctuation errors have been corrected.] APPEALS The data protection authority decides in the course of a public examination against N *** Bergbahnen GmbH, represented by B *** C *** D *** Rechtsanwälte GmbH, for infringement in the right to secrecy as a result of inadmissible image processing as follows: 1. The official test procedure was justified and it is determined that the image processing carried out by N *** Bergbahnen GmbH (automatically operated photo installation on the summer toboggan run) is inseparable from the contract of use consent is unlawful. 2. The N *** Bergbahnen GmbH is instructed to allow the processing of data by the image processing system within a period of eight weeks in case of other execution only if either a) the data subject has given their consent for data processing independently of the contract of use or b) In individual cases, there are predominantly legitimate interests of the person responsible or of a third party and the proportionality is given. 3. The N *** Bergbahnen GmbH is instructed to refrain from the current form of image processing (that is, on the basis of a declaration of consent inseparable from the contract of use) with immediate effect in case of other execution. Legal basis: §§ 1 (1), 12 (1) and (2) of the Data Protection Act (DSG), BGBl. I No. 165/1999 as amended, as well as Art. 7 and Art. 58 para. 1 lit. b and para. 2 lit. d and f of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR), OJ 1. Statement of reasons A. Submission and procedural procedure On 27 July 2018, the data protection authority was informed by an e-mail addressed to the N *** Bergbahnen GmbH automatic photo system , The photo system would automatically photograph the customers of the summer toboggan run while driving and save the images automatically. These pictures can be viewed and bought after the trip. It is not disclosed where and how long these images are stored. Also you can not refuse the automatic photo shoots on site. The N *** Bergbahnen GmbH brought together with comments from August 30, 2018 before, in the route of the operated summer toboggan run is a so-called Actioncam, by means of this automatically a photograph of the sledging guests at a previously sufficiently clearly and visibly marked spot would be made. The creation of the photograph is carried out automatically, in which the toboggan guest with the respective toboggan slide a light barrier will pass. In the entrance area of ​​the lift and at the entrance of the summer toboggan bilingual signs were set up, which would point to the Actioncam. Through these signs, the toboggan guests would be visibly pointed out that driving on the summer toboggan run and the opportunity to purchase a corresponding souvenir photo of the Actioncam would be a common and uniform subject of the contract. By purchasing the ticket, the toboggan guests would have effective (conclusively granted) consent to the image capture. In the course of the toboggan run various signs were placed in clearly visible places, which would indicate to the tobogganist in how many meters distance the Actioncam was positioned. For every toboggan guest there is the possibility to take adequate measures in time to avoid being photographed by the Actioncam. Also the toboggan guests would be explicitly pointed out on the homepage on the photograph. At the same time, potential tobogganists would be reminded that every person who agrees to buy a ticket agrees to receive a commemorative picture during the sledding trip. The duration of the image storage would be a maximum of 14 hours, the photo data would be deleted every day at 23:00. B. Object of the case The subject-matter of the proceedings is the question of whether the toboggan guests are instructed to submit a consent which does not comply with the requirements of the GDPR and thus be infringed in the right to secrecy. Another legal basis was not put forward by N *** Bergbahnen GmbH. The subject matter of this review procedure is therefore not the question of whether the image processing in question can be based on any other material under Article 6 DSGVO or § 12 (2) DSG. C. Facts The N *** Bergbahnen GmbH operates a summer toboggan run at the address E *** - Weg * 7, *** 3 N ***. In the route of the operated summer toboggan run is a so-called "Actioncam" of the model Aixis P1357-E. On the website of N *** Bergbahnen GmbH, the following note (spelling as in the original) can be found: "Each guest agrees with the ticket purchase, or passing through the turnstile agrees that the N *** Bergbahnen GmbH during departure with the summer toboggan run stores / publishes action photos of adults and their accompanying children for 24 hours for later sale to the tobogganists. Any use for any other purpose is excluded and requires the special written consent of the customer. "In the course of the toboggan run various signs are placed in clearly visible places, indicating to the tobogganist in how many meters distance the Actioncam is positioned , For example, to avoid being picked up by the Actioncam, there are only ways to hide the face or turn aside. The Actioncam was provisionally decommissioned by the N *** Bergbahnen GmbH on 08.08.2018. Evaluation of evidence: The findings are based on the submissions of N *** Bergbahnen GmbH dated 30.08.2018 and on the information on the homepage (https: //e***berg.n***-info/, last accessed on April 15, 2019). D. From a legal point of view it follows: 1. Pursuant to Section 12 (2) of the DSG, image processing may be necessary. then permissible if the data subject has consented to the processing of their personal data. According to Art. 7 DSGVO and in consideration of Art. 4 Z 11 and ErwGr 43 DSGVO, consent must be voluntary and must not be linked to the performance of a contract, although the consent to fulfill this contract is not required. A consent is involuntary if a disadvantage is to be expected if the consent is not given. The former Art. 29 Data Protection Working Party has addressed the concept of 'consent' in its Guidelines and has carried out a thorough analysis of the term (see Article 29 Data Protection Working Party Guidelines on Consent under Regulation 2016/679, WP 259) , rev. 01). The element "free" implies that the data subjects have a real choice and control. In general, the GDPR requires consent not to be valid if the person concerned has no real choice, feels compelled to give consent, or if he or she does not consent. If the consent is a non-negotiable part of terms and conditions, it is assumed that the consent was not given voluntarily. Article 7 (4) of the GDPR points out, inter alia, that a situation in which the consent is "bundled" with the acceptance of contractual terms or the performance of a contract or the provision of a service with the request for consent to processing of personal information that is not necessary for the performance of the contract is considered to be highly undesirable. If consent is granted in such a situation, it is deemed not to have been voluntarily granted (see recital 43 GDPR). Consequently, if the person responsible links the fulfillment of a contract with the request for consent, a data subject who does not wish to provide the data subject with the personal data for processing will incur the risk of being denied benefits for which he has requested , The responsible person must prove that it is possible to deny or revoke the consent, without suffering any disadvantages. For example, it must demonstrate that denying or revoking consent does not result in costs for the data subject and, consequently, a clear disadvantage. Furthermore, the person responsible should demonstrate that the data subject had a genuine or free choice, whether he or she agrees (see also Advocate 42 DSGVO, see also the decision of 30 November 2018, DC DSB-D122.931 / 0003-DSB / 2018). With the coupling of the consent to a processing of contract-independent personal data with a contract conclusion is to be assumed in principle that the granting of the consent does not occur voluntarily, if in individual case special circumstances for a voluntariness of the data protection consent speak (see in addition the judgment of the OGH of 31 August 2018, GZ 6 Ob 140 / 18h mwN). 2. Relating to the present case, this means the following: In the specific case, the trip with the summer toboggan run and the picture by the Actioncam according to the explanations of N *** Bergbahnen GmbH constitute a common and uniform object of the contract. The permission to take pictures and thus in A processing of personal data is "coupled" to the fulfillment of a contract and thus to the use of the summer toboggan run, although the consent for the performance of the contract - the use of the summer toboggan run for a fee - is not necessary or necessary. A real or free choice, whether one is taken by the camera, does not exist. If an affected person does not consent to the recording, the consequence and the clear disadvantage is that he can not use the summer toboggan run. The possibility of covering one's face or turning aside before passing through the light barrier does not change this, because even in these cases personal data are available; Users of the toboggan run can also be identified with relatively little effort (see the ECJ judgment of 19 October 2016, C-582/14 for a broad interpretation of the term "personal date"). The performance mandate according to item 2 is based on Art. 58 para. 2 lit. d DSGVO, that according to item 3 of Art. 58 para. 2 lit. f DSGVO. A period of eight weeks seems appropriate to comply with the performance mandate set out in Item 2. A prohibition of the current form of data processing is necessary, because this is classified as unlawful. It was therefore appropriate to decide.
