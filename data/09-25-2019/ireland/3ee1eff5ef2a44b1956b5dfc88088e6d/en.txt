Statement from Helen Dixon on her reappointment as Commissioner for Data Protection 
28th May 2019
I welcome the Government’s early decision and announcement in relation to my reappointment as Commissioner for a second term. At this early but critical juncture of GDPR implementation and enforcement, continuity is important to drive clarity for organisations around the standards they must meet in order to effectively safeguard the data protection rights of service users, consumers and citizens. It is a privilege to serve in this role and to work with the dedicated staff of the Data Protection Commission. Our fellow EU data protection authorities count on us to effectively supervise the large internet platforms headquartered in Ireland and we are committed to this task.
