There are several purposes for publishing information in WHOIS, in particular:

creating openness for a primary technical contact with the person (s) behind a domain name, for example if the content of the domain name is not available, or if a third party is committing cybercrime from the domain name,
to create transparency about who is responsible for the content of a domain name, so that the person (s) can be contacted in order to make any liability for content on a website applicable. Finally, the Danish Data Protection Agency notes that, by letter of 5 July 2018, the European Data Protection Council, in relation to the global WHOIS database managed by ICANN, has stated, among other things: following:
“The EPDB considers that registrants should in principle not be required to provide personal data directly identifying individual employees (or third parties) fulfilling the administrative or technical functions on behalf of the registrant. […] It should therefore be made clear, as part of the registration process, that the registrant is free to (1) designate the same person as the registrant (or its representative) as the administrative or technical contact; or (2) provide contact information that does not directly identify the administrative or technical contact person concerned (e.g., admin@company.com). " On July 10, 2018, the complainant has complained to the Danish Data Protection Agency, as DK Hostmaster continues to publish personal data on proxies for domain name registrants, including complaints.
