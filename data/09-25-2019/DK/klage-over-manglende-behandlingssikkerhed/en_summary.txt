Article 32 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation Paragraph 1 states that, taking into account the current technical level, the cost of implementation and the nature, scope, coherence and purpose of the processing, and the risks of varying probabilities and seriousness of the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data controller undertakes appropriate technical and organizational measures to: ensure a level of security appropriate to these risks. Your comments
You have stated that a caseworker in the Køge Jobcenter uses a notepad and Post-Its to write information about you and other citizens, including information about social security number, name, middle name, district and unemployment period information, so that the information is visible to outsiders. Thus, Article 1 (1) contains an obligation on the data controller to protect both sensitive information and confidential and ordinary non-sensitive information, and the data controller must ensure that the data controller's systems, organization and workflows are arranged so that the requirements of Article 32 (1) apply. Finally, the Data Inspectorate has noted that the Municipality of Køge has stated that your complaint has given the Køge Job Center a number of general considerations, including making the disposal of notes from the conversation more visible to the individual citizen so that suspicion of poor data protection does not arise, and to respond if a citizen actively indicates that he / she does not want notes on paper by simply entering the information in the case system along the way.
