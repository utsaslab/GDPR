Obvious spelling, grammatical and punctuation errors have been corrected.] APPEALS The Data Protection Authority decides on the complaint of László A *** (complainant) of 4 September 2018 against N *** Ges.m.b.H. (Respondent) for an infringement in unspecified data protection rights, in particular in the right of cancellation (Art. 17 GDPR), as follows: - The appeal is rejected. Legal basis: Article 8 of the Federal Constitutional Law (B-VG), Federal Law Gazette No. 1/1930 as amended, Section 13 (3) of the General Administrative Procedure Act 1991 (AVG), Federal Law Gazette No. 51/1991 as amended. EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM A. Arguments of the parties and procedure 1. The complainant e-mailed the data protection authority on 4 September 2018 (same day inbox) with an English-language copy attached to the copy of a longer e-mail correspondence , The content suggests that the complainant lodged a complaint against N *** Gesellschaft m.b.H., which is based in **** Vienna. because of an infringement of the right to cancellation (Art. 17 GDPR). In other circumstances (no indication of a domestic delivery point, use of an e-mail address in the domain "*** mail.co.uk") there is the presumption that the complainant has no residence or habitual residence in Austria). 2. The DPA issued on 18 September 2018 on DC: DSB-D130.092 / 0001-DSB / 2018 the following remedy: "Subject: Remedy of deficiencies Your complaint to the DPA on 4 September 2018 was found to be inadequate for the following reasons and needs improvement:  The complaint is not written in German, which language is to be used as the constitutional official language of the Republic in all submissions to Austrian authorities (Article 8 of the Federal Constitutional Law - B-VG). Please remedy this deficiency by introducing or completing the complaint again. For the fulfillment of this defect recovery order, a period of two weeks from receipt of this letter is set. If no improvement takes place, rejection of attachment is to be expected in accordance with § 13 (3) of the General Administrative Procedure Act 1991 (AVG). In the absence of an entry in German, a further substantive examination of the appeal has not yet taken place. For submissions please use the forms available on the website of the DPA: https://www.dsb.gv.at/dokumente. They are also free to expressly withdraw their complaint (without incurring any costs) in accordance with Section 13 (7) of the General Administrative Procedures Act 1991 (AVG). Where appropriate, they may also, in accordance with Article 77 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO), contact the supervisory authority responsible for data protection at their usual place of residence or employment in the territory of the European Union, using a language which is permissible there. Please inform the Austrian Data Protection Authority and, at the same time, withdraw the complaint now pending. "3. The complainant responded by submitting an entry of 20 September 2018 which, while containing quotes on several provisions and recitals of the GDPR in German, however, its submissions to the Authority are again in English. The complainant has conclusively stated that he insists on reimbursing his arguments in English. 4. B. From a legal point of view, it follows 5. Pursuant to Section 13 (3) of the General Administrative Procedure Act 1991 (AVG, BGBl. No. 51/1991 as amended), deficiencies in written affixing do not authorize the authority to reject it. On the contrary, the authority must, of its own motion, promptly remedy the defect and, within a reasonable period of time, may order the remedy to be rectified, with the effect that the affixing is rejected after the expiry of that period. If the defect is remedied in time, the attachment is considered to have been originally introduced correctly. 6. Written and oral attachments must always be formulated in German; as well as in the case of impermissible submissions, the authority may also proceed in accordance with § 13 (3) AVG (Note B of 15.10.1984, 84/08/0106, VwSlg 11556 A / 1984, or E of 19.10.1994, 94 / 01/0294). Neither the accession of Austria to the European Union nor the amendment of section 13 (3) AVG changed anything (VwGH, E 20.06.2017, Ra 2016/01/0288, RIS, RS 1). 7. The DPA has also informed the complainant about the legal situation in accordance with § 13a AVG. Article 77 of the GDPR states that an individual, when exercising his or her rights under administrative law, has the international choice between several supervisory authorities in the territory of the European Union, namely the habitual residence of the data subject, their place of work or the place of the alleged infringement. Since the Respondent appears to be established in Vienna, the latter would constitute a competence of the Austrian Supervisory Authority. However, it can not be deduced from this that a procedure before the DPA may be requested and conducted by a party under procedural law in a language other than the constitutional official language. Rather, the alternative recovery authorities should allow a data subject to approach a more geographically closer supervisory authority whose official language is familiar. 8. The complainant has not eliminated the identified defect despite the possibility (in the form of a defect removal order). 9. The application submitted in the present form is therefore not in accordance with the law. The complaint was therefore, as announced, dismissed in accordance with § 13 para 3 AVG.
