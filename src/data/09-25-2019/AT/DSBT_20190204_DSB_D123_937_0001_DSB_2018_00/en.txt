Received on 19 December 2018, against the Supreme Court (Respondent) for breach of the right to secrecy as follows: - The appeal is dismissed. Legal basis: § 1 Abs. 1 Data Protection Act - DSG, BGBl. 165/1999 idgF; Section 85 (1) and (2) Court Organization Act - GOG, RGBl. 217/1896 as amended; Art. 82 and Art. 92 of the Federal Constitutional Law (B-VG), Federal Law Gazette No. 1/1930; Section 15 (4) and (5) Federal Law on the Supreme Court - OGHG, BGBl. Nr. 328/1968 idgF; EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM A. Arguments of the parties and procedural step By way of interlocutory petition of 18 December 2018, ho. Received on 19 December 2018, the complainant alleged that the Respondent had made insufficient anonymization in the decision documentation of his judgments in the Federal Legal Information System (RIS), thereby violating his right to confidentiality. The respondent was the Supreme Court (OGH), which issued the decision specified in the complaint. B. From a legal point of view: according to Art. 55 (3) GDPR, the supervisory authorities are not responsible for the supervision of the processing carried out by courts in the context of their judicial activity. According to ErwGr. 20 of the GDPR, this serves the independence of the judiciary in the performance of its judicial functions, including its decision-making. Supervision of data processing operations should be entrusted to specific bodies in the Member States' judicial system. The GDPR itself does not expressly state which judicial activity constitutes a judicial activity. According to a well-established literature, matters which have to be dealt with in the context of instruction-bound administration of justice do not fall under the term "judicial activity" (for more details see Schmidl in Gantschacher / Jelinek / Schmidl / Spanberger, Commentary on the General Data Protection Ordinance1 [2017] Art. 55 Note 3; Nguyen in Gola (ed.), General Data Protection Regulation [2017] Art. 55, para. 13; Selmayr in Ehmann / Selmayr (ed.), DS-GVO [2017] Art. 55, par. , According to the case - law of the DPA, judicial activity is the work of a court when a judge is in the exercise of judicial office or a judge or public prosecutor is otherwise instructed to take care of the duties conferred on him (see the decisions of October 2018, DC DSB-D123.461 / 0004-DSB / 2018, as well as from January 22, 2019, DC DSB-D123.848 / 0001-DSB / 2019). As far as the legal documentation is concerned by the Supreme Court, § 15 OGHG orders the following: In the decision documentation of the federation (RIS) names, addresses and if necessary also other place and area designations, which permit conclusions on the case concerned, by letters, numbers or Anonymise abbreviations so that the traceability of the decision is not lost. These orders must be taken by the recognizing Senate in the resolution. Since the designated act was the independent exercise of the judicial office, a complaint to the Data Protection Authority is not permitted. The legal protection for alleged violations of the right of confidentiality by a court in the context of judicial activity is governed by §§ 83 ff GOG. The complaint was therefore dismissed in accordance with the rules
