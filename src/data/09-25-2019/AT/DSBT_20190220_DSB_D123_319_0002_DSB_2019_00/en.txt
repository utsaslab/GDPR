Ingomar D ***, of 14 August 2018 against N *** Information GmbH (Respondent), represented by C *** Rechtsanwälte, C *** H *** U *** GmbH, for breach of the right to Deletion as follows: - The appeal is dismissed. Legal basis: §§ 24 (1) and (5) of the Data Protection Act - DSG, BGBl. I No. 165/1999 as amended; Art. 5 para. 1 lit. b, 6 para. 1 lit. f, 17 para. 1 lit. a and lit. d of the General Data Protection Regulation - DSGVO, OJ 1. Statement of reasons A. Arguments of the parties and procedure 1. By submitting an inducement of 14 August 2018, the appellant summarized, in essence, that he had served in the District Court in Vienna in 2011. a debt settlement procedure was carried out, which had been canceled after acceptance of a payment plan. The payment plan was fully fulfilled on 3 February 2017, whereby the residual debt relief had occurred. The consumer credit register, the credit card database and the N *** alert file would to this day reveal personal data of the complainant, such as his date of birth, his home address and details of his former debt. By letter of 11 June 2018, the Respondent was requested to delete the data because the purpose for which the data had been collected no longer existed. However, the Respondent refused to delete it on the grounds that there was no reason for deletion. 2. In addition, by letter of 20 September 2018, the complainant stated that he had fulfilled all his financial obligations since 2012, demonstrating over the years that he was able to settle all his debts in due time through his income. The retention of data in the Respondent's databases can not be justified by creditor protection or risk minimization, as there is no increase in risk for lenders. The purpose of the original data collection thus falls away, which is why an erasure reason according to Art. 17 para. 1 lit. a GDPR is available. 3. By observations of 11 October 2018, the Respondent summarized that the legal basis for the processing of the complainant's personal data was Article 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO. The processing of the data is necessary and appropriate for the protection of the interests of the business users of the credit reference agency as well as in the interests of third parties (creditor protection). Information about a past inability to pay was, of course, relevant to the assessment of creditworthiness and constituted an essential and necessary basis for decision-making. A past insolvency usually constitutes a risk increase in the granting of credit and thus continues to serve the purpose of processing the complainant's personal data upright. Deletion periods exist for the file systems managed by the Respondent. These were determined on the basis of the decisions of the DPA. The time limits would only start to run after the debt has been paid or another debt-discharging event has occurred. The deletion of the data would be carried out automatically after their expiration. 4. The complainant has not made use of the opportunity to comment on the results of the preliminary proceedings within the party hearing pursuant to Section 45 (3) AVG. B. Object of the complaint On the basis of the procedure described above, the subject of the complaint is the question of whether the Respondent infringed his right of cancellation by rejecting the request for cancellation of the complainant's personal data. C. Determination of facts The Respondent operates the business of the credit bureau. A complainant's debt settlement procedure was opened in 2011 at the District Court V ***. The payment plan was accepted and legally confirmed. The debt settlement procedure was lifted and the end of the payment period was determined on 2 March 2017. The following data of the complainant are stored - in part - in the data bases of the Respondent: [Editor's note: The printouts from the data processing of the Respondent reproduced here as facsimile can not be pseudonymised at a reasonable cost. They contain the personal data (name, date of birth, current address) of the complainant, further known (previous) address data, a "RiskIndicator" (value: 602) as well as an estimate of the likelihood of payment default (value: 50.39%), data on the carried out Bankruptcy proceedings, registrations relating to the complainant in a register of consumer credits (V *** - Evidenz) maintained by the Respondent, a credit card database and a warning file for lenders, as well as the entry in an entrepreneur file of the Respondent (in the latter only personal data)]. By letter of 18 June 2018, the complainant requested the deletion of his personal data in the warning file for lenders and in the register of consumer credit. As grounds for the cancellation he made Art. 17 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. By letter of 25 July 2018, the Respondent refused to delete the complainant's personal data. Proof of evidence: The findings are based on the parties' submissions and the documents submitted during the proceedings. D. From a legal point of view, it follows: 1. In the present case, the appellant requested, in accordance with Article 17 (1) (a) of the GDPR, the immediate deletion of the data referring to him. The purpose for which these data were collected has been completed, since it is now debt-free, has a regular income and, by completing the payment plan, has demonstrated its ability to meet its financial obligations. 2. At the outset, it should be noted that the processing of data relevant to creditworthiness by a credit bureau within the meaning of Section 152 of the Gewerbeordnung (Register of Trade) is covered by this provision and the lawfulness of the processing of such data is therefore not dependent on the prior consent of a data subject. It can also be assumed that the legal basis of this activity is that the legislature starts from the basic admissibility of this commercial activity, so that it can give a legal power to process this data. Since the exercise of this commercial activity without collection, storage and disclosure of relevant data can not reasonably be imagined, it must also be assumed that the legislator in certain case categories a legitimate interest of those concerned interests of these traders in the use of data on "credit" as given (see also the recommendation of the Data Protection Commission of 7 May 2007, GZ K211.773 / 0009-DSK / 2007, see also OGH of 21 January 2015, GZ 17 Os 43 / 14y). 3. In the absence of special rules for credit bureaus, the general principles of the GDPR are applicable, according to which, inter alia, Personal data may only be collected for specified, unambiguous and legitimate purposes (Article 5 (1) (b) GDPR). Accordingly, it should first be noted in the present proceedings that the purposes of the data processing in the Respondent's database are to allow those undertakings access to the data which, in the course of their economic activity, incurs a credit risk, for example in the supply of their goods or services (eg Delivery on open account). Under certain conditions, the lawfulness of the processing according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. to affirm DSGVO. 4. The subject of the proceedings, however, is the question of how long payment history data can still be stored with the Respondent after settlement of the claim before it is no longer necessary for the purposes of processing (creditor protection); only if the personal data is still credit-relevant, is a processing purpose pursuant to Art. 5 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO. If there is a purpose of processing the credit-relevant data, it can be concluded that personal data allowing an assignment of credit-worthy data to a data subject (eg name, date of birth and address) may in principle also be processed. 5. There is no statutory limit to how long records may be stored in databases of credit bureaus. 6. The Data Protection Commission has for example in the decision GZ K600.033-018 / 0002-DVR / 2007 to "small loan (consumer) for the purpose of creditor protection and risk minimization" to the legal situation before the entry into force of the GDPR regarding the deletion of all entries in connection with a concrete Credit debt ratio defined various deletion periods. However, these requirements also differentiated with regard to the deletion of entries relating to a specific credit relationship, i.a. for example, after full repayment of the debt after payment (deletion at the latest after five years), with final determination of the non-existence of the alleged payment (deletion no later than 90 days after complete payment of the debt or if the determination took place only after this period: immediately after final determination) and only in all other cases, seven years after repayment of the debt or the occurrence of another debt-discharging event. 7. In addition, deletion periods also result from the Insolvency Code (IO). The legal validity of the opening of insolvency proceedings depends on the publication in the insolvency file. The data - as objectively for example in the context of a debt regulation procedure - are in principle up to one year after completion of the insolvency procedure callable (see § 256 IO). 8. The allegedly bad creditworthiness of the data subjects resulting from historical "payment history data" (negative entries) should be kept away by the possibility of a timely deletion after settlement of all claims. In particular, it should be avoided that those persons who have regained a sound financial basis after the cancellation of a debt settlement procedure or after payment of their debts outside the insolvency proceedings will again encounter difficulties in the course of business, as their creditworthiness is diminished by these negative registrations. A general deletion of the credit-relevant data only seven years after the debt has been repaid will, in view of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. In any case, in view of the changed legal situation since the date on which the above-mentioned decision of the Data Protection Commission was issued (cf the cited provisions of the IO), it must not be proportionate. 9. The view of the Respondent that the entry in the Consumer Credit Register and the Alert File on the basis of notices of the Data Protection Authority must be canceled only after seven years and the bankruptcy after five years can not be upheld. These notices as well as all others, which were issued in the course of a registration procedure according to §§ 17 ff DSG 2000, have expired ex clusively on May 25, 2018 (§ 69 Abs. 2 DSG). As the DPA has already stated in a recent communication (see DSB of 7 December 2018, DSB-D123.193 / 0003-DSB / 2018), it considers that it is required by its u.a. in the notification GZ K600.033-018 / 0002-DVR / 2007 on the "Small loan (register of consumer credit) for the purpose of creditor protection and risk minimization" expressed legal view on the retention period. Rather, an individual case assessment, taking into account all relevant circumstances, seems necessary. Decisive for the assessment can u.a. - the amount of the individual claims, - the age of the claims (the date of entry in the database), - the number of claims collected through a collection agency, - the time elapsed since the claim was settled , - the origin of the data. 10. For the purposes of the present proceedings, this means that, in addition to the complainant's name, address and date of birth, the information on the insolvency proceedings appears from the complainant's database, as can be seen from the findings. The liabilities according to the bankruptcy petition refer to 27,400 euros. In the V *** - evidence, a completed loan (of December 2001) in the amount of 6,900 euros, which was settled in the context of the insolvency proceedings with payment plan of 2 March 2017, appears to be credit-relevant. In the warning file also appear a loan with the amount of 5,001 to 6,000 euros and the partial repayment with 2 March 2017 (Note: fulfillment of the payment plan) on. The complainant's debt settlement procedure is no longer published in the insolvency file as it had already been deleted pursuant to § 256 (2) (4) IO. Even after the publication of the debt settlement procedure in the bankruptcy file, however, information about it may still be credit-worthy in terms of creditor protection. In each case, the payment experience data are credit data to a not inconsiderable extent. Although the claims have already been made in one case at least ten years ago, it is clear from the Respondent's entries that the loans have only been partially settled since March 2017 as part of the insolvency proceedings (fulfillment of the payment plan). Due in particular to the size of the individual claims and the short time that elapsed between the complainant 's request for cancellation and the fulfillment of the payment plan (less than two years), it can be assumed that the Respondent' s legitimate interest in using the data on "Credit" of the complainant over the complainant's interest in the deletion of the data outweighs. At present, the data covered by the applicant's request for deletion is still credit-relevant in terms of creditor protection, which is why the complainant's personal data are still necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed. This also includes the other personal data of the complainant, such as in particular name, date of birth and address of residence, which allow a clear assignment of the credit-related data to the complainant. Irrespective of the fact that the complainant has fulfilled his payment plan and thus the reason for deletion in Art. 17 para. 1 lit. A DSGVO had been implemented and had been deleted, was not brought forward by the appellant. Against this background was to decide according to the award.
