Michael A *** (Appellant), represented by Attorney Mag. Peter B ***, dated 27 August 2018 against the N *** Aktiengesellschaft (Respondent), represented by C *** Rechtsanwälte GmbH, for infringement of the right to secrecy and breach of the obligation to inform as follows: - The appeal is dismissed. Legal basis: §§ 1 (1) and 24 (1) and (5) of the Data Protection Act (DSG), BGBl. I No. 165/1999 as amended, Article 4 items 1 and 2, 6 and 13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR), OJ 1. Statement of reasons A. Arguments of the parties and procedure 1. By letter of 27 August 2018, the appellant alleged infringement of the obligation to inform and the lawfulness of the processing under Article 6 GDPR and brought In essence, he has the habit of paying for his purchases at the private label and subsidiary companies of D *** International AG mainly by cash card. The complainant does not have a valid customer card of the Respondent. For each cashless payment transaction in the Respondent's branches, a regular customer query will be displayed at the card terminal prior to the actual payment transaction, in which case the computer-aided data processing for the complainant manifests itself beyond doubt. For the complainant, it was completely unclear whether there was a link between the query "regular customer" for cashless payments and the customer loyalty program and whether group-wide links were made. In particular, it would appear unclear which data would be collected or stored by the Respondent in this repeat customer inquiry. By e-mail of 11 June 2018, the complainant had asked the Respondent to provide information on the abovementioned data processing. In response, the Respondent has communicated the following: "When paying by ATM card is queried by the ATM card terminal, whether on the ATM card a so-called 'company bit' is deposited, so whether the customer card is stored on the ATM card. In this context, no data is processed. There is also no assignment of payment data. The mere question of whether a customer card is stored on the ATM card is by no means unlawful. "The complainant had never given his consent to the automated regular customer inquiry through a customer terminal in the Respondent's branches. The complainant expressly objected to this unlawful processing by letter dated 12 June 2018. The Respondent failed to cite the purposes for which the complainant's personal data were being processed in accordance with its duty to inform (within the privacy statement). The illustrated regular customer query was clearly to qualify as processing of data. According to Art. 6 (1) GDPR, data processing is only lawful if one of the conditions of the subparagraph lit. a to f is satisfied. As a result, the data processing is neither covered by the privacy statement nor by a consent. 2. By a statement of 30 October 2018, the Respondent summarized that in its capacity as a retailer with branches throughout Austria it operates a customer loyalty program, for which customer cards would be issued by the Respondent. At the customer's request, the debit card can also be used as a customer card. In such a case, once the "Firmenbit" is activated on the ATM card and a storage area activated. The initialization of the "Firmenbits" on the ATM card takes place at the cashier of the Respondent. For cashless payment transactions, the payment terminal checks whether the "Company Bit" function has been activated. If so, it is checked whether the mentioned memory area on the ATM card is activated. If this function is not activated, no further queries or data processing would be carried out. As information to the customer using the ATM card, the text "repeat customer inquiry carried out" is displayed on the ATM card terminal. However, contrary to the complainant's presentation, no personal data would be processed. Only if the memory area is activated will the respondent - in a second step - read a numerical code stored there from the chip. Only this numerical code allows the result - after various technical intermediate steps - the assignment of the ATM card as a customer card to the respective member of the client club of the Respondent. Since no data processing takes place in the present case, because the complainant is not involved in the customer loyalty program of the Respondent, the Respondent is not responsible for any data processing and would therefore not meet the obligations associated therewith, in particular information obligations under Art. 13 and 14 DSGVO. 3. By letter dated 5 March 2019, the Respondent technically supplemented its comments and sent the processor agreement between the card terminal operator and the Respondent. In summary, the Respondent reiterated that no processing of the complainant's personal data had taken place. In order to prevent misunderstandings regarding the cashless payment and the data processing of the Respondent and to comply with the transparency requirement pursuant to Art. 5 para. 1 lit. In order to better comply with the DSGVO, the Respondent added a paragraph to the use of the ATM card as a customer card for the loyalty program. This was also brought to the attention of the complainant. 4. In the context of the hearing of the parties, the complainant stated in a letter of 26 March 2019 regarding the duty to provide information pursuant to Art. 13 GDPR that it was an "irrefutable fact" that the Respondent, before amending the Data Protection Declaration, was obliged to provide information pursuant to Art. 13 GDPR hurt. In order to safeguard his legitimate interests, the complainant seeks a declaration of breach of the obligation to inform. As regards the infringement under Article 6 GDPR, the complainant essentially stated that the Respondent had processed personal data without a corresponding wording in its privacy policy. Since the beginning of December 2018, the "regular customer inquiry" criticized by the complainant had no longer been reported as an "insert" on the Respondent's payment terminal. However, there would still be two separate data queries. The complainant assumes that the Respondent simply continued her unlawful data processing without citing the word "repeat customer inquiry". Furthermore, personal data would be processed. By the query of the so-called "company bits" could be the assignment of a natural person to an identification number or their identification, which is also the case with the "pseudo-anonymization" the case. The purpose of the repeat customer inquiry is to identify a natural person and to verify the existence of a membership in the Respondent's customer loyalty program. It would be in the query of the "Firmenbits" no so-called "pseudo-anonymization", as this is precisely the attribution of a natural person should be made possible. The query of the so-called "Firmenbits" should therefore be qualified in any case as the processing of personal data. 5. In addition, the complainant stated by letter of 28 March 2019 that it had now emerged that the Respondent had not changed its privacy policy. The Respondent did not carry out this simple operation within three weeks. The complainant was therefore still complaining about the duty to inform under Art. 13 GDPR. B. Object of Appeal The subject of the complaint is the question of whether the Respondent infringed the complainant's right to secrecy by querying the "Firmenbits" in the context of the regular customer query for cashless payment. In addition, the question arises as to whether the complainant has been infringed in his right to information pursuant to Art. 13 GDPR due to an inadequate privacy policy in relation to the "regular customer inquiry" at the payment terminal. C. Determination of facts The Respondent is a retail company with branches throughout Austria. In the course of this activity, the Respondent operates a customer loyalty program which grants customers discounts and other advantages when presenting a loyalty card to be issued by the Respondent. At the request of the customer, the debit card can be used as a customer card. If the ATM card is used as a customer card, the "company bit" is activated on the customer's ATM card. On the debit cards issued in Austria is the file "EF_RFU2", consisting of 196 bytes. It includes the regular customer number, merchant bitmap and merchant data. Of these, 8 bytes are used for the regular customer number, 8 bytes for the bitmap for company bits, and 180 bytes for the merchant data. The file "EF_RFU2" is neither freely readable nor freely writable. The file "EF_RFU2" and the bitmap are as follows: [Note: The graphic files (screenshots) with a tabular representation of the files in question can not be displayed in the RIS.] One byte consists of 8 bits (Note: one bit corresponds to one character). Therefore, bytes 0 to 7 have a total of 64 bits, with only bit 1 being allocated to the use of the repeat customer query by the Respondent. All other bits correspond to the value 0 and are not assigned. In the course of the regular customer inquiry at the payment terminal, it is read out on bit 1 whether the debit card for the customer loyalty program of the respondent has been initialised. If the regular customer function is activated on the debit card, the bit (bit 1 of the bitmap) is set to 1 during initialization and the data transmitted by the retailer are written to the card. This initialization takes place exclusively if the cardholder has actively agreed to use the respective customer program and wishes to use the ATM card instead of the customer card. In the course of the regular customer inquiry, the retail fund can use the terminal to query whether the regular customer function is used on the cardholder's debit card. Subsequently, the terminal reads the encrypted data from the card and verifies that the correct company bit is set. After completing the check, the terminal either sends only the message "no regular customer" or "regular customer" to the retailer. The technical process is shown schematically as follows: [Note: The graphic file (screenshot) reproduced in the original here with a tabular representation of the relevant process can not be displayed in the RIS.] The trade fund sends the order record as part of the regular customer query "Stkf query without card return" to the terminal: [Note: The graphic files (screenshots) with a tabular representation of the relevant process reproduced in the original can not be displayed in the RIS.] The terminal's response to the cash register does not contain any Customer data, but only the terminal ID, date and time. Only in the event that the debit card has been initialized as a customer card, the data written during initialization are returned to the trading treasury. The complainant does not participate in the customer retention program of the Respondent. On its debit card, the "company bit" is not activated (i.e., set to 0). Proof of evidence: The findings concerning non-participation in the Respondent's Loyalty Program are based on the consistent submissions of the parties to the proceedings in their letters to the Data Protection Authority. The findings regarding the technical procedure of the regular customer query based on the respondent's statement of 5 March 2019, the comprehensible and understandable to laymen the technical functioning of a company and the technical process of activation and non-activation of the "Firmenbits" in the context of the regular customer query has shown , The appellant did not oppose these remarks in the context of the party hearing either. The complainant's allegation that an essential purpose of the regular customer check on cashless payment is to establish a personal reference may also not be convincing, since that query does not say anything about whether the customer generally participates in the customer loyalty program. In addition to using the ATM card as a customer card, the Respondent separately issues customer cards. D. From a legal point of view it follows: The Data Protection Authority assumes that a data subject can rely on any provision of the GDPR also apart from the data subject rights under Chapter III, if this results in a possible violation of the right to secrecy under § 1 para 1 DSG (see the decision of 30 November 2018, GZ DSB-D122.931 / 0003-DSB / 2018). In the present case, the appellant's allegation was therefore to be reviewed with regard to a breach of the duty to inform under Art. 13 DSGVO and concerning the allegation of an infringement under Art. 6 DSGVO with regard to the right of confidentiality pursuant to Sec. 1 DSG. Processing of personal data: Pursuant to § 1 Abs. 1 DSG, everyone, in particular with regard to the respect of his private and family life, has a right to confidentiality of his personal data, as far as there is a legitimate interest in it. This is to be understood as the protection of the data subject before his data is ascertained and the protection against the disclosure of the data obtained about him. Purely conceptually, this process thus requires processing of personal data by the responsible person. Article 1 (1) GDPR also states that the Regulation contains provisions for the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data. The prerequisite for an infringement of the right to secrecy pursuant to § 1 DSG as well as information according to Art. 13 GDPR to exist as far as possible is the processing of personal data by the person responsible. Personal data are, according to the definition in Art. 4 no. 1 DSGVO, all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. In this case, a natural person is considered to be identifiable if it can be identified directly or indirectly, in particular by association with an identifier or with several special features. Processing is understood to be any process performed with or without the aid of automated processes, or any such sub-series relating to personal data such as collecting, collecting, organizing, organizing, storing, adapting or modifying, reading out, querying the use, disclosure through transmission, dissemination or any other form of provision, reconciliation or linking, restriction, erasure or destruction (see Article 4 (2) leg.cit). In the matter: The data processing concerns the query regarding the regularity of the customer in the course of cashless payment to a trading counterparty of the Respondent. An order is sent to the payment terminal by the retailer. This then reads out whether bit 1 is activated on the file "EF_RFU2" or has the value 0. In the case in question, the complainant does not participate in the customer loyalty program of the Respondent, which is why no customer card is activated on his ATM card. Therefore, in case of cashless payment by the complainant, the commercial cash register only receives the indication "no regular customer" from the terminal. The terminal's response to the Respondent's register does not contain any customer information, just the terminal ID and the date and time. The note "no customer" and the terminal ID, the date and time are without any additional information to any information that may relate to an identified or identifiable natural person. Further data is not processed in the process of the invention. As a result, the complainant - in the absence of processing his personal data - in the course of the regular customer query for cashless payments neither in his right to secrecy under § 1 DSG in conjunction with Art. 6 GDPR, nor in his right to information duty in accordance with Art. 13 GDPR. Any processing of personal data in the context of cashless payment is not part of the procedure. Since the complaint proved to be unjustified, it had to be dismissed pursuant to Section 24 (5) DSG.
