Eduard A *** (Applicant) from **** city, dated 24 March 2019, to answer the following questions Issue: 1. Is there any question as to whether, in the case of a substantive complaint by the appellant in the appeal proceedings before the Administrative Court (VwGH), compensation for expenses, judicature or what is the legal situation here ?; and 2. Does the VwGH or the Federal Administrative Court (BVwG) decide on the state of the case in the appeal proceedings due to a breach of duty to provide information ?, as follows: - It is determined that the coveted information is not subject to the right to information and the information therefore not granted. Legal basis: § 1 para. 1 and 2 and § 4 of the obligation to provide information (Information Provision Act 1987), Federal Law Gazette No. 287/1987 as amended. EXPLANATORY STATEMENT A. Procedure, procedural facts and application: 1. The applicant has a legal background and has repeatedly complained to the data protection authority on his own behalf. In the context of the application he is a party involved in the proceedings concerning the revision of B *** Bank AG against the finding of the Federal Administrative Court of 10.12.2018, GZ: W2 ** 3 * 4 * 2 * 7-1 / 7E, to which also the Data Protection Authority is involved as an official party (a pending authority). 2. Assessment of evidence: These findings are based on facts and data on which the DPA is aware (see, inter alia, Administrative Records Zlen. DSB-D122.746, DSB-D062.124, DSB-D073.044 and DSB-D078.535). 3. On 18 March 2019, the complainant addressed in a personal addressed to Mag. Michael Suda, the administrator of the DPA from the proceedings cited in the above evidence, e-mail addressed to them and put (mutatis mutandis and summed up), inter alia, in the Saying quoted questions. 4. On the same day he was replied as follows (to the sending address Eduard.A***@***mail.de): "Michael Suda to Mag. Eduard A *** (requestor) Request for transmission and read receipt. Reply-to set to: dsb@dsb.gv.at (please answer only to this address) Dear Mr. Mag. A ***! First, I will take her below quoted message along with my answer to a related matter as attachments to the act. Secondly, please direct messages relating to a procedure of the DPA exclusively to the address of the authority: dsb@dsb.gv.at. There is only this single address allowed and publicized for email traffic with the DSB. The person handling the administrative matter may change at any time, personal mailboxes being viewed and read in the absence of the owner (leave, illness, business trip, leaving the service of the DSB) only in justified exceptional cases. Third, I can not offer you personal advice on specific legal issues. Procedure is a procedure, and there is no "private sphere" between a speaker and a party that can be used "off-the-record" for dialogue. As far as the interpretation of obligations under the Information Provision Act is concerned, I must treat you as any requester: the Data Protection Authority does not offer individual legal advice beyond the guidance on procedural procedures in DSB complaints proceedings. The question of which substantive legal position to apply in "transitional cases" pursuant to section 69 (4) and (5) DSG of the administrative courts is also controversial and has already been the subject of at least one not yet decided (revision) procedure at the Administrative Court. Sincerely, --- Michael SUDA Data Protection Authority (Attention, from 15.3.2019 new address!) Barichgasse 40-42 A-1030 Vienna Landline: +43 1 52152 2554 Mobile: +43 676 89891 2554 "[Quote of the request not shown here] 5. Assessment of evidence: These findings are based on the content of the cited e-mail bill linked to the introductory piece (request for information). 6. Then, on 24 March 2019, the complainant sent an e-mail with the following contents to the Data Protection Authority (dsb@dsb.gv.at): "Ladies and Gentlemen, I note that the Data Protection Authority receives my notice from 18.03.2019 qualified as information request in the sense of the information obligation law of the federation. With regard to this legal opinion of the DSB, I hereby submit the application for a decision under § 4 Information Compensation Act. Respectfully, Mag. Eduard A *** "7. Proof of evidence: as last. B. In legal terms, this implies B1 Normative content of § 1 Information Duty Law 8. The purpose and purpose of the right to information guaranteed by Article 20 (4) B-VG is to enable citizens to access information about which only the public Administration, in particular if the access to the coveted information for exercising the right to freedom of expression, in particular the freedom to receive and communicate messages or ideas, is instrumental. The restrictions on the obligation to provide information must be interpreted strictly if a request for information is to be regarded as a relevant preparatory step for journalistic or other activities designed to create a forum for public debate, if the requested information is in the public interest and has a role for the respondent "watchdog" within the meaning of the case law of the ECtHR (see the considerations of the VwGH in the E of 29.05.2018, Ra 2017/03/0083). 9. Conversely, in the context of the obligation to provide information, it is not the task of an authority to obtain information that it does not have itself or to accept professionally or privately-qualified practitioners, such as lawyers, trainee lawyers or other practicing lawyers Conduct judicial research and then inform the requestors of the result. 10. Information within the meaning of the information obligation laws of the federation and the countries always have knowledge declarations to the object, whereby their contents are only such information, which are already known at the time of the request of the administration and not procured by the requested administrative unit for the purpose of fulfilling the obligation to provide information Need to become. Provision of information means passing on information about a file content which, as a rule, will not show the level of detail of information that would be obtained by accessing the file. The use of the term "information" implies that the administration is not obliged to conduct extensive elaboration, to provide expert opinions or to obtain information that is otherwise accessible. In this respect, the submission of the information to the other tasks of the administration is deducible from the law, which means that requests for information must contain specific questions which can be answered within the short term without affecting the other administrative procedures (VwGH, E 27.11.2018, Ra 2017 / 02/0141, RS 2 with reference to annulment 41 BlgNR 17. GP, 3, VwGH of 9 September 2015, 2013/04/0021, see also about VwGH of 26 November 2008, 2007/06/0084, VwGH vom July 23, 2013, 2010/05/0230). B2 Legal conclusions 11. The questions posed by the applicant do not fall within the regulatory scope of the DPA. The Authority is confronted with pertinent legal issues only as part of its procedural role as an official party in administrative court proceedings. In this respect, the data protection authority and the applicant, who are both parties to an appeal procedure concerning a finding of the Federal Administrative Court, are faced with access to the requested information at the same level. 12. The first question of the applicant was not to be answered, since it is already on the basis of the wording of the question ("What is the legal situation?") To a request for the preparation of a legal opinion, the fulfillment of which according to § 1 Abs 1987 no claim exists. 13. Both questions of the applicant in common is the question of possible jurisdiction. The complainant has already been informed of the second question in Mag. Suda's reply, from its own knowledge, that the relevant question has not been decided and at least one relevant procedure is pending before the Verwaltungsgerichtshof. 14. Whether there is any further relevant case law, such as those of the Federal Administrative Court, the DPA can not state with certainty the file situation and the knowledge available to the authority. However, on the basis of his training, the applicant would have to be able to obtain this information himself from other sources, such as research in the Federal Public Information System (RIS) set up specifically for such purposes, in which all decisions which are not merely procedural in accordance with § 20 BVwGG Federal Administrative Court to procure. 15. The request for information was therefore dismissed in accordance with the rules.
