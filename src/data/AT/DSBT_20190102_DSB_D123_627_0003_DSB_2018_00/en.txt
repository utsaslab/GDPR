The complaint for violation in the right to information is rejected. 2. The appeal for breach of the lawfulness of the consent is rejected. 3. The complaint concerning the alleged breach of the duty to inform is rejected. Legal bases: § 13 Abs. 3, § 13 Abs. 8, § 38a, § 73 Abs. 1 General Administrative Procedures Act 1991 - AVG, BGBl. 51/1991, as amended, § 24 Abs. 2, § 24 Abs. 6 and 10 Data Protection Act - DSG, BGBl. 165/1999, as amended; Article 15, Article 56 (1), Article 77 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO), L119 S.1, as amended; EXPLANATORY STATEMENT A. Arguments of the parties and procedural background By submitting an interlocutory petition on 17 October 2018, the complainant alleged that he received unsolicited advertising from the company N *** travel and that this was by no means lawful since he had never given his consent to advertising emails to obtain. By submitting the following entry dated 15 November 2018, the complainant stated that he had received an e-mail stating that within the group of companies to which the designated Respondent belonged, a transfer of data had taken place and that he did not understand why he had to cancel within two weeks (as in the letter), which must contradict data transmission. With clearance GZ: DSB-D123.627 / 0003-DSB / 2018 of 20 November 2018, the DPA requested to rectify deficiencies, in particular to designate the rights deemed to be infringed and a clear respondent. By submission of 25 November 2018, the complainant submitted further e-mail correspondence, including an e-mail dated 25 November 2018 requesting information, stating that he designated the respondent with N *** travel B.V. and considers that both the right of access according to Art. 15 GDPR and the right to information on the collection of data by the data subject under Art. 13 GDPR are violated. Furthermore, the provisions of Article 7 concerning the conditions of consent were violated. B. Factual findings By submission of 17 October, the appellant filed a complaint against N *** travel B.V. for violation of the right to information and information. A request for information was not addressed to the Respondent at this time. The Respondent has branches in several Member States of the European Union. Proof of evidence: Evidence was collected through the complainant's submissions and through an official search on the homepage https: //n***travel.at/datenschutzerklaerung. C. From a legal point of view, it follows: On appeal 1: The complainant alleges an infringement in the right to information without having made a request for information forming the subject-matter of the proceedings. The subject of the data protection complaint procedure is constituted by the complainant's constituent complaint. In a procedure where formal defects are to be eliminated by the competent authority in accordance with § 13 (3) AVG, the procedure-introducing input which has been properly improved must be used. The subject of the proceedings in the first sentence is the alleged infringement in the right to information. At the time of the complaint, no request for information had been made to the designated respondent. Art. 15 DSGVO is conceptually a law requiring a claim and requires a limine a request received by the designated respondent. Since only remediable defects are at all accessible to an order in accordance with § 13 para. 3 AVG, in the case of defects which are not accessible for remedy, the request for lack of evidence of complaint has to be rejected. After the hg. Case law on recoverable or irrecoverable defects must be distinguished as to whether the circumstance to be proved is missing at the relevant time (this is an unrecoverable defect) or if there is a lack of evidence of the already existing circumstance (in the latter case the defect can be remedied; the ed. B of 11 November 2015, Ra 2015/04/0077, mwN). The subsequent submission of a data protection request to the designated Respondent does not cure the unrecoverable deficiency that the complainant lacked legitimacy in relation to the alleged facts at the time the complaint was lodged, but is assumed to have a different life circumstance which is not identical with the process object (maNw .: VwGH 21.12.1987, 87/10/0051). The complaint concerning the alleged infringement of the right to information had to be dismissed. Regarding point 2: The complainant subsumes the lack of information on the proof of what he considers a necessary consent under Art. 7 DSGVO: A complaint must fulfill the formal requirements of § 24 DSG. In accordance with § 13 para. 3 General Administrative Procedure Act 1991 (AVG), BGBl. Nr. 51/1991 idgF. In case of written defects, the authority does not authorize the rejection. On the contrary, the authority must, of its own motion, promptly remedy the situation and may order the intervener to remedy the defect within a reasonable period of time, with the result that the affixing is rejected after the expiry of that period. If the defect is remedied in time, the attachment is considered to have been originally introduced correctly. With the order to remedy deficiencies on 20 November 2018, the DPA requested the complainant to remedy the more detailed formal deficiencies, in particular the rights he considered to have been infringed. This remedial order was not adequately fulfilled within the set time limit for award 2, in that the appellant relied not on a subjective right, which is prescribed by § 1 DSG and Chapter III DSGVO, but on Art. 7 "Conditions for consent". § 24 para. 2 no. 2 DSG speaks of a right that has been violated. The provision mentioned by the complainant does not standardize any law, but merely certain conditions which can constitute a justification for data processing. From the above provision no subjective law can be derived per se, which is why, according to the wording of § 24 (2) (2) DSG, the condition that the right considered to be infringed must not be fulfilled. The complaint concerning an infringement of the right pursuant to Art. 7 DSGVO was therefore to be dismissed in accordance with Section 13 (3) AVG. As regards paragraph 3: the respondent referred to N *** travel B.V. as Respondent in the proceedings. Notwithstanding the correspondence from which it would have been clear to the complainant that N *** travel B.V. is not responsible for data processing within the meaning of Art. 24 DSGVO and therefore also not the according to § 24 Abs. 2 Z. 2 DSG to be designated Respondent, it follows from the privacy statement of N *** travel that N *** BV not responsible for the alleged breach of information obligations is: "C *** Ltd. is a British company headquartered in London and operates the website "n *** travel.at". The Administrative Court, in its case law on the DSG 2000, which is relevant here, asserts that the alleged infringement must be attributable to the legal entity (decision of 26 June 2018, Ra 2017/04/0032). When assessing party attachments, the content of the attachment is basically decisive (finding of the VwGH of 10 February 1998, 97/04/0231), a public "reinterpretation" is therefore out of the question. It was therefore also a preliminary investigation whether a sole responsibility of the Austrian Data Protection Authority, or a leading responsibility of another supervisory authority is not to initiate but to dismiss in accordance with the award.
