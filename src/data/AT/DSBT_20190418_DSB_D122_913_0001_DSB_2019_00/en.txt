After the termination of the proceedings, the complainant had requested access to the file. The Respondent had complied and sent a copy of the act to Zl. MA 36- * 4 * 2 * 7-2016 by post to the complainant. Those parts of the file, from which the name of the ad creditor emerges, were excluded from the inspection of the file in accordance with § 17 Abs. 3 AVG. Further steps were not to be set in the opinion of the Respondent. 3. In the granted party hearing on the Respondent's opinion (letter of the DPA of 25.10.2018), the complainant did not deliver an opinion within the period of two weeks granted. B. Object of the complaint On the basis of the complainant's allegation, it emerges that the subject of the complaint is whether the advertisement from 2016 and, in particular, its consignor, are covered by the right to information, nevertheless access to the file pursuant to § 17 (3) AVG was refused.

The address R *** straße * 5/1, 1 *** Wien, is indicated in the complaint as the submission of the complainant. The publisher wanted the confidential treatment of his name. The Respondent conducted a preliminary investigation against the complainant under number MA 36- * 4 * 2 * 7-2016, which was subsequently discontinued. After the termination of the proceedings, the complainant requested access to the file in case MA 36- * 4 * 2 * 7-2016. The Respondent granted this access to the file in February 2017 by sending a copy of the act, excluding those parts of the file that made up the Advisor from access to the file in accordance with Section 17 (3) AVG. The complainant confirmed on 14 May 2017 the receipt of the copy of the file. Proof of evidence: The findings made are based on the undisputed written submissions of the parties, which are contained in the act. D. From a legal point of view: D.1. General The legal situation at the time of the decision of the Data Protection Authority is decisive, unless it concerns the assessment of behavior at a certain point in time. The object of the complaint, however, is not based on a specific key date or period. The alleged infringement (incomplete information) is still ongoing. Accordingly, according to the legal position in force on May 25, 2018, the procedure previously conducted under DSG 2000, Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 (as amended by Federal Law Gazette I No. 83/2013) as appeal proceedings under § 24 DSG, Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 idgF, to continue and to decide on the new legal situation (see § 69 (4) DSG). D.2. Applicable Legislation: Art. 15 para. 1 and para. 4 DSGVO read together with headline (emphasis added by the Data Protection Authority): Article 15 Right to information of the data subject 1. The data subject shall have the right to ask the person responsible for confirmation of: personal data concerning them are processed; if this is the case, it has a right to information about such personal data and to the following information: a) the processing purposes; b) the categories of personal data being processed; (c) the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or are being disclosed, in particular in the case of beneficiaries in third countries or international organizations; (d) if possible, the planned duration for which the personal data are stored or, if this is not possible, the criteria for determining that duration; (e) the existence of a right to rectification or erasure of the personal data concerning him or of a limitation of the processing or a right to object to such processing by the controller; (f) the existence of a right of appeal to a supervisory authority; g) if the personal data are not collected from the data subject, all available information on the source of the data; (h) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, as referred to in Article 22 (1) and (4) and, at least in such cases, meaningful information about the logic involved and the scope and intended impact of such processing on the data subject. (2) [...] (3) (4) The right to receive a copy in accordance with paragraph 1b shall not prejudice the rights and freedoms of other persons. § 17 AVG including headline (emphasis added by the Data Protection Authority): Access to the file § 17. (1) Unless otherwise provided in the administrative regulations, the parties may inspect the authority's files relating to their case and files or parts thereof Make copies on the spot or have copies or printouts made at your expense. Insofar as the authority electronically keeps the files concerning the case, the party may upon request be granted access to the file in every technically possible form. (2) All parties to a proceeding must, upon request, be granted access to the file to the same extent. (3) The access to the file shall exclude elements of the file, insofar as their access would cause damage to the legitimate interests of a party or third parties or jeopardize the duties of the authority or impair the purpose of the proceedings. (4) The denial of access to the file to the party to a pending case is made by order of procedure. D.3. In the case itself: 1. The complainant claimed that the improvement of 2 June 2018 was incomplete. Failure to provide the information was therefore not the subject of the proceedings. The complainant, summarized, believes that there is a concrete, substantive component of the file - namely a copy of the adver- tisers' e-mail ad (including photos) - which he is party to proceedings Zl. MA 36- * 4 * 2 * 7-2016 the assertion of the right of access to the file had not received, to obtain the assertion of the right to information. 2. First of all, it should be noted that the previous case-law on the right to information pursuant to Section 26 DSG 2000 was fundamentally dismissive of information in the sense of a copy of specific elements of the file (see decision of the Data Protection Commission of 4 June 2001 to GZ K120.810 / 005-DSK / 2001 , Decisions of 27 June 2012, GZ K121.803 / 0008-DSK / 2012, and of 25 April 2008, GZ K121.340 / 0006-DSK / 2008, decisions of 9.3.2015, GZ DSB-D122.299 / 0003-DSB / 2015, and of 27.10.2014, DC DSB-D122.215 / 0004-DSB / 2014). On the one hand, this was justified by the fact that section 26 (1) of the DSG 2000 and the constitutional provision of section 1 (3) no. 1 DSG 2000 are restricted to the personal data of a data subject used for automated processing or processing in manual files (such as card systems). are determined. On the other hand - based on the cited constitutional provision and § 26 (1) DSG 2000 - there was neither a right to information on third party data nor an enforceable right to receive document copies. Finally, Paragraph 26 (8) of the DSG 2000 states that to the extent to which the use of data with regard to the processed data is legally available to the data subject (ie if substantive legal provisions grant the data subjects access to the data), the data protection right to obtain information The provisions of the substantive provisions providing for the right to inspect, and for which the legal provisions governing the procedure of inspection are relevant. 3. The now applicable DSG provides in § 4 (5) and (6) DSG also exceptions to the right to information in accordance with Article 15 GDPR - namely in the sovereign domain in accordance with § 4 paragraph 5 DSG, if the provision of the information the performance in private or in the context of private sector management in accordance with § 4 para. 6 DSG if the provision of the information would jeopardize a business or company secret of the person in charge or a third party. However, both limitations are not applicable in this case. 4. Therefore, only the relevant facts of the case are governed by Art. 15 DSGVO ("Right to information of the data subject"). The DSGVO itself mentions files and file collections (even assuming that these are paper files) in ErwGr. 15 last sentence, these paper files should not fall under the DSGVO only if the criterion of the file system is not met, thus an order according to certain criteria (so at least two criteria) is not present. E contrario it must be concluded that the DSGVO is in any case applicable to electronic files - as used, inter alia, by the Respondent. ErwGr. The second sentence mentions that the content of files is in principle subject to the right of access (arg. "This includes the right of data subjects to provide information about their own health-related data, such as data in their medical records, information such as diagnoses, examination results, Findings of the treating physicians and information on treatments or procedures "). Article 15 (3) GDPR stipulates that the person responsible shall provide a copy of the personal data, whereby paragraph 4 stipulates in a restrictive manner that this does not affect the rights and freedoms of other persons. It can be deduced from this that, by means of a request for information, information about the content of documents and file components can in principle be requested. 5. However, according to Art. 15 GDPR, as in the past, information is limited to its own data, that is to say according to the wording of Article 15 (1) of the GDPR, "it [ie. the data subject ". Therefore, there is basically no further right to information about the personal data of third parties, unless in individual cases there are special reasons for doing so (see, for example, the decision of 6 June 2018, DC DSB-D122.829 / 0003-DSB / 2018). In addition, Article 15 (4) GDPR further restricts the fact that the receipt of a copy of the personal data may in no case affect the rights and freedoms of other persons. Therefore, if a document to be provided (a "copy") contains data of third parties, a balance of goods shall be carried out and the data of third parties disclosed only if the reasons for the disclosure outweigh the reasons for confidentiality. 6. In the present case, the advertiser's express wish was for confidential treatment of his ad. Most of the reasons that would give priority to disclosure of confidentiality were not raised by the complainant. Consequently, Article 15 (4) GDPR precludes submitting the copy of the e-mail notification. 7. The appeal was therefore dismissed as unfounded.
