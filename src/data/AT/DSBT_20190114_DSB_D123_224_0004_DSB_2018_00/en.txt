The appeal is granted and it is determined that the Respondent has violated the Appellant's right to information by informing her that no personal data concerning her is being processed by the Respondent and the complainant's information pursuant to Art. 15 para. 1 lit. a to h DSGVO did not grant. 2. The Respondent is requested, within a period of two weeks in the case of other execution, to provide information about the complainant's personal data in accordance with Art. 15 para. 1 lit. a to h DSGVO provided information. Legal basis: § 24 para. 1 and 5 of the Data Protection Act - DSG, BGBl. I No. 165/1999 as amended; Art. 4 no. 1, no. 5 and no. 7, art. 15 para. 1 lit. a to h and para. 3, Art. 58 para. 2 lit. c and Article 77 (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR), OJ No. L 119 p. 1. EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM A. Arguments of the parties and procedure 1. By appeal of 18 July 2018, the appellant summarized that she had informed the respondents by letter dated 18 April 2018 that she had been informed pursuant to §§ 1, 23 , 26 and 50 DSG 2000 with regard to the personal data concerning the complainant. By letter of 8 June 2018, the persons responsible informed that they would not process any personal data concerning the complainant. The Respondent would generally accept only anonymised statements of facts and only in exceptional cases further documents (disregarding all personal data of third parties). The identity of the complainant was only known through the request for information. These statements, however, were incomprehensible to the complainant: From the Respondent's statement regarding double residency in Austria and Switzerland of 5 February 2018, the complainant's identification, even if not mentioned by name, was unequivocally possible. In this opinion may u.a. the complainant's address in Switzerland stated that she provided information about the location and the cultural and social identity of the complainant. It is to be assumed that the Respondent processed further personal data (such as data on travel and stays in Austria and Switzerland) during the preparation of the opinion. Otherwise, it would be unimaginable how the Respondent could have determined to the nearest percent where the Appellant and her spouse would have been for certain periods of time. The information given by the respondents was therefore incorrect and incomplete. 2. By observations of 4 September 2018, the Respondent summarized the nature of its activity and source of information, and would produce scientific papers and opinions on scientific methods in the fields of tax and economic research and related fields of law. As a rule, no own fact-finding surveys would be carried out; the reference framework of the opinions therefore consisted solely of information to the extent that it would be communicated by the respective clients, insisting as far as possible on anonymisation. It is also pointed out directly on the first page of the procedural opinion on double-entry residence that the subject-matter of the submissions is an issue communicated to the respondents. There was therefore no comprehensive data on the complainant's travels and stays. The facts to be assessed had been transmitted to the extent to which they had been described as facts in the Opinion by the tax representative of the applicant's deceased spouse. Moreover, there would be no "automated" processing: in the complainant's company, there was no IT system which could handle data independently according to certain procedures. Only standard software of the office area (for example word processing) with own inputs is used. Digital documents would only be manipulated on the basis of individual user commands, e.g. opened, changed, etc. The content of the same serve no machine-structured interpretations or archiving, but as an object of intuition and cognitive basis for subsequent - again human-generated - text elaborations. Therefore, at most, their activity could be in the area of ​​non-automated processing of data. In any case, there is no "processing" because there is no data-gathering structure or file system. If there were any personal information in the file, it would constitute at most a part of the documents sent to the respondent, which would not be sorted or structured according to such characteristics. A targeted approach without substantial prior knowledge of the data content is therefore not even possible via an electronic "text search", but could just be done by complete development of the entire content of the text. Even if the information presented here and included in the opinion were classified as "personal data" of the complainant, there is no content-based processing of the same, as it fundamentally and explicitly underlies the terms of the GDPR. Since the respondent had no orderly, structured or systematic information about the complainant, the latter could only be informed that no personal data concerning him were being processed by the respondent. Finally, the Respondent is only a processor under Article 4 (8) of the GDPR, whereas G *** & P *** Austria should be regarded as the person responsible under Article 4 (7) GDPR. However, the right to information under Article 15 GDPR can only be expressly asserted against the person responsible. 3. The complainant stated in the context of the party hearing granted by the Data Protection Authority that its own fact determination according to the definition of "processing" within the meaning of Art. 4 no. 2 DSGVO is not a prerequisite for the applicability of the GDPR. It is therefore entirely beyond dispute that the Respondent processes personal data within the meaning of the GDPR. So far, the Respondent has provided no substantive information about the processed data, which is why it could not be understood what data of the Respondent would be available. With regard to the existence of automated processing, reference is also made to the literature and case-law according to which automated processing is in any event involved if IT systems were used to process the data. For this distinction it is irrelevant whether individual automated data processing operations were performed automatically (for example by algorithms) or due to human input. A corresponding differentiation is at best relevant for Art. 22 GDPR. In addition, the respondent's statements, according to which a corresponding file system is also required for automated data processing, would contradict both the wording of Article 2 (1) GDPR and the level of opinion in case law and literature. As regards the Respondent's claim that it is a processor but not a controller, it is contrary to what was stated in the original information and in the respondent's observations. If the Respondent had actually only acted as a processor, an obligation to conclude a processor agreement pursuant to Art. 28 (3) GDPR and to keep a processing list pursuant to Art. 30 (2) GDPR would have existed and the Respondent would have already acted in its reaction to the original The complainant's application. B. Object of the complaint In the present case, the question arises as to whether the appellant was thereby infringed in her right to information because the Respondent granted her negative information. C. Determination of facts Within the scope of its activities, the Respondent prepares scientific papers and expertises according to scientific methods in the areas of tax and economic research and the related fields of law. The Respondent was commissioned by "G *** & P *** Austria" to draw up a tax law statement regarding "Questions of double residency in Austria and Switzerland". In this electronically written statement, statements u.a. the place of residence and the economic, cultural and social identity of a taxable person and his wife. This is the complainant. Neither the taxpayer nor the complainant are mentioned by name. Due to the numerous different data (location, family, economic and social identity of the complainant) the appellant can be identified for third parties. By letter of 8 June 2018, the Respondent informed the complainant that it did not process any personal data concerning the complainant in relation to the complainant's request for information. Proof of evidence: The findings are based on the complainant's consistent submissions in their letters to the DPA and the attached documents. The finding as to the complainant's identifiability in the Respondent's Opinion follows from the numerous information in the present Opinion, which, according to general experience, shows that only the Appellant is left by limiting potentially affected persons. D. From a legal point of view: Legal situation On 18 April 2018, the complainant submitted a request for information to the Respondent. The legal position at the time of the decision of the Data Protection Authority is decisive, unless it concerns the assessment of a behavior at a certain point in time. As far as the right to information is concerned, this right can - provided that the necessary conditions - until the end of the procedure before the Data Protection Authority (§ 24 para. 6 DSG), which is the subject of legal proceedings applicable since 25 May 2018 applicable law. The objective scope of DSGVO Art. 2 governs the material scope of application of the GDPR, which results from the form of data processing and the purpose pursued by it. With regard to the form of data processing, the scope of the GDPR is open when personal data is either fully or partially processed automatically or not processed automatically, but should be stored in a file or should be. It is therefore essential that either an operation or a sequence of operations carried out with the aid of automated processes is associated with personal data or the data is part of a collection structured according to specific criteria, so that easier access to the data is possible. In the current state of the art, it is to be understood that any form of storage suitable for automated processing meets the conditions to be considered a file system. With modern data analysis techniques, even little or unstructured data can easily be edited in such a way that information can be searched according to a wide variety of criteria. Basically, the rules of data protection should be technology-neutral. Only non-electronically recorded files, file collections and their cover sheets, which are not ordered according to certain criteria should fall outside the scope (Ehmann / Selmayr, DS-GVO, commentary, Art. 4 Z 35). Since the Respondent's statement has been electronically recorded and there is an action (electronically written opinion) in connection with personal data carried out by means of automated procedures, the data processing in question is covered by the scope of the GDPR. The legal qualification of a "file system" (Article 2 (1) leg.cit) does not arise because there is no non-automated processing. Personal reference In the present case, statements made by the Respondent regarding the domicile, the family and the economic situation, the applicant's social contacts as well as interests, hobbies, belonging to clubs or a round of the tribe are directly and indirectly indirect the relationship with the complainant's husband These data are in principle suitable for establishing a personal reference to the complainant (cf Art 4 Z 1 DSGVO). However, it is questionable for whom the person must be identifiable, so that a date is considered to be personal. Recital 26 states that, in order to qualify a database as personal data, it is not necessary for the controller to carry out the identification himself, but it is sufficient that any third party, in their general discretion, is likely to be able to do so, at the same time and expense such as the available technology and technological development (see also Ehmann / Selmayr, DS-GVO, Commentary, Article 4, marginal 17, cf also the judgment of the ECJ of 19 October 2016, C-582 / 14). In the present case, it must be assumed that the combination of several properties can narrow the circle of potentially affected parties to such an extent that only the complainant remains and thus becomes clearly identifiable. Due to the numerous different data (location, family, economic and social identity of the complainant), the complainant's identification will be affirmed without significant costs and excessive time (see also the recommendation of the Data Protection Commission of the Commission on the case of possible identification due to a limited number of persons) 22 May 2013, GZ K213.180 / 0021-DSK / 2013). Moreover, even if it were true that the Respondent's data were made available to the taxpayer mainly "anonymously", it can not be upheld: anonymised data are those that are not (anymore) refer to a specific or identifiable natural person. However, this can not be assumed in the present case, after what has just been said. In contrast, a pseudonymization (Article 4 (5) GDPR) has no effect on the personal reference of the data, as it is ultimately just another form of storage, but the person responsible still has access to the full information content of the data and the individual relationship of each Information element can be produced easily. This is also clarified in Note 26. Responsible persons in accordance with Art. 4 no. 7 GDPR are subject to the accountability according to Art. 5 Par. 2 leg.cit and must be able to prove compliance with the principles for the processing of personal data. This commitment demonstrates the degree of decision-making power that the controller or the co-controllers must have over the purpose and means of data processing. It can not always be assumed that the organization that has direct contact with the data subjects and, for example, carries out the collection or collection of the data can be regarded as the person responsible (Ehmann / Selmayr, DS-GVO, Commentary, Art 38) Insofar as the persons entrusted with the implementation can use the provided data beyond the order for their own purposes or can modify the purpose themselves, or if they have considerable design or choice of means of processing, they are responsible together with the client and have correspondingly more extensive obligations (Ehmann / Selmayr, DS-GMO, commentary, Art. 4 no. 41). If the Respondent believes that she is not responsible because she herself does not collect any facts but relies solely on information provided to her by the respective clients, this legal opinion can not be approved for the following reasons: the Respondent's decision to use the data transmitted by third parties. For the autonomy of the data-processing body (Respondent) also speak a self-interest in the data processing as well as the technical implementation of the processing beyond contractual services in the form of independent and instruction-free preparation of a tax position. The independence of the instructions of a client results already from the essential feature of the activity of the Respondent as the author of "scientific papers and reports on scientific methods in the areas of tax and economic research". The Respondent has thus provided services with its own discretion, a comprehensive instruction by the client "G *** & P ***" or a control of the lawfulness of the data processing by these has not emerged in the proceedings before the Data Protection Authority. In particular, it is unclear to what extent the Respondent was unable to decide for himself how long data will be kept or who will have access to the processed data. Finally, it must be remembered that this does not preclude, however, that the interaction of a project and the synopsis of Art. 4 Z 2 and Z 7 DSGVO in the interpretation of the area of ​​responsibility of an individual responsible different levels of data processing (such as collection, storage, etc.). ) can be distinguished. Depending on the organizational structure of a project, it may be necessary to distinguish between individual activities controlled or carried out by a specific body or different areas of activity and responsibility (see, for example, Sydow, European Data Protection Regulation, Hand Commentary, Article 4, item 126; the Opinion of Advocate General Bobek in Rs C-40/17). Information According to Art. 15 GDPR, the data subject's right to information requires that he / she has the right to require the person responsible to confirm whether personal data relating to them are being processed. If this is the case, it has a right to information about these personal data as well as to the information provided in Art. 15 para. 1 lit. a to h leg. cit. enumerated information. In the present case, it would therefore be appropriate for the respondent to provide this information to the complainant. An information to the effect that no personal data of the complainant are processed (so-called negative information), since this is not true as stated, is not sufficient. Furthermore, the Respondent did not claim that it was not possible to identify the Appellant (see Article 11 GDPR). Conclusion The Respondent failed to provide proper information by the end of the present proceedings, which led to the finding of a breach of the right of access and the Respondent's request for full information. It was therefore appropriate to decide.
