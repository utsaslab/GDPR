Legal basis: §§ 1 (1) and (2), 24 (1) and (5) of the Data Protection Act (DSG), BGBl. I No. 165/1999 as amended; Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a, Art. 7, Art. 21, Art. 57 para. 1 lit. f and Art. 77 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), OJ C. No. L 119 of 4.5.2016, p. 1; Section 96 (3) of the Telecommunications Act (TKG 2003), BGBl. I No. 70/2003 as amended. GROUNDS A. Arguments of the parties and procedure 1. By submission of 25 May 2018, the complainant alleged infringement of the right of opposition and summarized that the Respondent's website could only be used for a fee once consent had been given to " Marketing cookies "revoke. He received this message immediately after the "revocation-click". The consent is not voluntary in accordance with the principles of the GDPR, since the provision of the service is subject to the consent to the processing of personal data. The tracking of personal data is technically not necessary because the Respondent offers a payment option that can do without this tracking. An example of personal cookies without an opt-out option is google_pub_config. A corresponding screenshot was added to the input. 2. In a statement issued on 12 June 2018, the Respondent summarized that media companies have been reliant on advertising for decades, and this type of online media financing has been largely the sole source of revenue since its inception. In the "DSGVO Implementation", the Respondent not only implemented the standardized requirements, but also developed a privacy-conscious online product: the O ** subscription (in the following: "O ** subscription"). With the O ** - subscription no consent to advertising circuits would be connected and only technically necessary cookies would be set. In fact, the contradiction to advertising measures according to Art. 21 GDPR is possible on the website and leads to the objection that the website can no longer be used completely free of charge. In this case, only selected pages without editorial contributions would be available. The full use of the O ** subscription is alternatively possible. The requirement of voluntary consent could not lead to media companies having to provide their services free of charge, especially since online advertising without data-based control would not allow refinancing in the current market environment. As part of the pricing has been taken to ensure that the O ** subscription for anyone remains affordable and it does not become an obstacle to an ad-and tracking-free use of the online offer. The offer of these two variants does not constitute a violation of the GDPR. With regard to the missing "opt-out possibility" for the cookie "google_pub_config", it should be noted that this is a technical error that has now been resolved, so now for all technically unnecessary cookies an "opt-out" available. 3. The DPA granted the applicant by letter of 14 June 2018 appropriate party hearing and submitted the result of the preliminary investigation. The complainant did not issue an opinion until the proceedings were closed. A corresponding forwarding report is enclosed with the file and there is no error message from an e-mail server. B. Object of the complaint On the basis of the appellant's allegation, it appears that the present complaint consists of two points: 1. First, it must be verified whether the respondent has required the complainant to give consent that does not comply with the requirements of the GDPR Complainant was breached in the right to secrecy. 2. In addition, it must be verified whether the Respondent has violated the Appellant's right of opposition (or lack of the right to revoke consent) by not providing it with an opt-out option with regard to the "google_pub_config" cookie , C. Determination of facts 1. The Respondent operates an online community on the webpage https: //www.n***-zeitung.at and provides - among other services - daily journalistic articles on various topics online. When you first visit the website, a pop-up window will appear with the following content (formatting not reproduced 1: 1): [Note editors: underlines in the following quote in the original HTML hyperlinks] "I agree with the use of cookies for the Web analytics and digital advertising purposes. Even if I continue to use this website, this is considered consent. I can revoke my consent here. Further information can be found in the privacy policy. Subscription without data approval With an n *** - zeitung.at O ** subscription, the entire website may be used without the consent of cookies and without advertising. Subscription Details. "2. Visitors to the Respondent's webpage have the option of clicking on the" OK "button or on an area outside the window by mouse click, which gives their consent (" Option 1 "). If consent is granted, visitors may use the Respondent's webpage. The webpage will be made available to third parties as advertising space in this variant. These are the use of "advertising cookies" or are foreign cookies in use. 3. The Respondent in its privacy policy - in the form of a button - provides an opportunity to revoke the consent. If the consent is revoked, the Respondent's webpage can no longer be used or the window described in Section 1 can be displayed again. 4. As an alternative, visitors to the Respondent's webpage can click on the "O ** - Subscription" button in the window described in Section 1 ("Option 2"). 5. At the conclusion of a paid O ** subscription (currently: EUR 6, - per month from the second month, as of November 29, 2018) the entire website of the Respondent can be used, no data tracking takes place and no foreign cookies are set , No data tracking means that all third-party third-party scripts and cookies as well as social media plug-ins are permanently disabled, which can be individually activated by the visitor. 6. For Variant 1 and Variant 2, there is no difference in terms of the content of the Respondent's webpage. 7. The complainant has called the Respondent's web page and made use of Variant 1 in order to gain access to the content of the website. 8. At the time the complainant's complaint was lodged on 25 May 2018, there was no "opt-out" regarding the cookie "google_pub_config". However, this possibility was implemented in the remainder of the appeal proceedings on the Respondents homepage, which was brought to the attention of the complainant by letter from the DPA of 14 June 2018. Evaluation of evidence: The findings are based on an investigation of the publicly accessible webpage of the Respondent, http: //n***-zeitung.at/ (retrieved on 29 November 2018), as well as on the undisputed submissions of the complainant dated 25. May 2018 and the Respondent of 12 June 2018. The complainant has not contested the subsequent implementation of an opt-out option with regard to the cookie "google_pub_config", despite the possibility of doing so. D. From a legal point of view this implies: D. 1. The right to secrecy a) The right to appeal The DPA has already stated that the data subjects are listed exhaustively in Chapter III of the GDPR (Articles 12 to 23) to become an affected person in the context of a complaint procedure, however, to any provision of the GDPR, as far as this may result in a possible violation of the right to secrecy under § 1 paragraph 1 DSG (see DSB of 13 September 2018, DSB-D123.070 / 0005 -DSB / 2018, according to which a breach by the controller of Article 32 may lead to a breach of Section 1 (1) of the DSG (see DSB 31 October 2018, DSB-D123.076 / 0003-DSB / 2018) a complaint is possible based on Art. 14 GDPR). In the present case, the complainant [editor's note: in the original text due to an obvious editorial error: "Respondent"] voluntarily states that he gave his consent and submits that the consent requested by the Respondent does not meet the requirements of Art. 7 GDPR , It was therefore necessary to check whether the variant 1 provided by the Respondent (consent to gain access to the content of the webpage) was voluntary and, if so, whether this would infringe the complainant's right to secrecy. b) Regarding § 96 (3) TKG 2003 as lex specialis In the already mentioned decision of the DSB of 31 October 2018, the Data Protection Authority examined the relationship between GDPR and Directive 2002/58 / EC ("e-Datenschutz-RL") of the corresponding implementation provision (TKG 2003, BGBl. I Nr. 70/2003 idgF). From the point of view of the Data Protection Authority, the e-Data Protection Directive or the TKG 2003 takes the form of the DSG 2000 or DSGVO as lex specialis (see Article 95 GDPR, according to which the Regulation links natural or legal persons with regard to processing does not impose any additional obligations on the provision of publicly available electronic communications services in public communications networks in the Union, insofar as they are subject to specific obligations set out in the e-Privacy Directive which pursue the same objective, see also recital 173 GDPR). In the present case, the question of the legal basis or the grounds for refusal of the processing in accordance with § 96 para. 3 TKG 2003, according to which a determination of data (or the use of advertising cookies) is only permitted if consent was granted. An assessment of the lawfulness of the processing therefore does not take place pursuant to Art. 6 GDPR, but according to Art. 96 (3) TKG 2003. However, it should be noted that the TKG 2003 does not provide for any further conditions or a definition of consent. However, the legal basis of EU law underlying this provision, the e-Privacy Directive, refers to the consent within the meaning of Directive 95/46 / EC (Data Protection Directive, see Article 2 (f)) with regard to the concept of 'consent' e-Privacy Directive). The concept of consent pursuant to Section 96 (3) TKG 2003 therefore corresponds, in a systematic interpretation, to the concept of consent pursuant to Article 4 (11) or Article 7 GDPR, as is apparent from Article 94 (2) GDPR. c) The voluntary nature of the consent in the present case The complainant argues that the consent to variant 1 is not voluntary under Article 7 (4) GDPR, since the provision of the service depends on the consent to the processing of personal data. According to Art. 7 DSGVO and in consideration of Art. 4 Z 11 and ErwGr 43 DSGVO, consent must be voluntary and must not be linked to the performance of a contract, although the consent to fulfill this contract is not required. A consent is involuntary if a disadvantage is to be expected if the consent is not given. The former Art. 29 Data Protection Working Party has already addressed possible disadvantages that prevent voluntary action and has come to the conclusion that such a disadvantage exists when there is a risk of deception, intimidation, coercion or significant negative consequences. The responsible person must prove that it is possible to deny or revoke the consent, without suffering any disadvantages. In addition, the controller should demonstrate that the data subject had a genuine or free choice, whether to consent or not (see Article 29 Data Protection Working Party Guidelines on consent under Regulation 2016/679, WP 259, rev. Page 12, see also recital 42 GDPR). In the present case, it should first be noted that the Respondent in variant 1 (consent to the use of the webpage) does not set cookies until the visitor to the web page has made a conscious decision, ie has given consent, if he wishes to make use of variant 1 , By linking in the window ("pop-up") to the privacy policy and by a list of cookies in use ("cookies attachment"), the Respondent also in § 96 paragraph 3 TKG 2003 iVm Art. 5 para lit. A DSGVO requires a transparent information requirement and also has a clear and specific purpose, which ensures that the data subject has control over the processing of their data. If an affected person does not give consent, the first consequence is that they can complete an O ** subscription. This O ** subscription is - as stated - free of advertising, free of data tracking and free from the setting of foreign cookies. The O ** subscription is also a disproportionately expensive alternative with a price of 6 euros per month from the second month onwards. The second consequence of not giving consent is that the data subject does not use the Respondent's webpage and uses an alternative information service. As a result, the consequences of failing to give consent are far from significant and the person concerned is not confronted with any significant negative consequences. Likewise, according to the case-law of the DPA, it should be borne in mind that voluntary consent may be given if a particular processing operation is also for the benefit of the person concerned (see instead of many DSK dated 8 March 2006, DSK 8.3.2006, K178.209 / 0006-DSK / 2006, see also Kotschy in Brodil (ed), Data Protection in Labor Law (2010) 3). This is in the present case given that a visitor to the web page after giving consent to full access to the web page and the services of the Respondent receives, this access - as stated - is in no way limited and content to the conclusion of an O ** - Subscriptions equals. Since the consent was given voluntarily, taking into account the provisions of Art. 4 and 7 GDPR, it was no longer necessary to determine whether a consent which had been given involuntarily gave rise to an infringement of the right to secrecy. It was in this regard to decide according to the award. The question as to whether the (advertising) cookies to be accepted in terms of their scope and scope correspond to the requirements of Art. 25 GDPR was not to be examined here. D. 2. The right to objection It must be noted that the right of objection expressly asserted by the appellant according to Art. 21 DSGVO is missing insofar as the appellant has given his consent pursuant to § 96 (3) TKG 2003 and rather is a question of withdrawal of consent. In the present case, however, this question is unnecessary, since the Respondent has implemented a way to revoke the cookie "google_pub_config" even before the end of the procedure, as well as the possibility (in the form of a button in the privacy policy, in the window or "pop-up" is made available) to revoke the consent in full (see § 24 para 6 DSG). In the context of § 96 Abs. 3 TKG 2003 is also to be noted that a revocation can also be made at any time by appropriate settings in the browser or by deleting all or individual cookies in the browser settings. The complainant was thus from the beginning of several technical options open to revoke the consent. It was therefore also in this regard to decide according to the award.
