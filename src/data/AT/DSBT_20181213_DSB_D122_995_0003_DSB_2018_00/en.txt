The appeal is upheld and it is found that the Respondent infringed the Appellant's right to cancellation by processing and countering his personal data (traffic data within the meaning of Section 92 (3) no. 4 TKG 2003) beyond a permissible period of time his application was not deleted. 2. The Respondent is requested to delete or anonymise the complainant's traffic data within a period of 2 weeks in case of other execution. Legal basis: §§ 24 (5) of the Data Protection Act (DSG), BGBl. I No. 165/1999 as amended; Sections 92 (3) (4) and 99 of the Telecommunications Act 2003 (TKG 2003), BGBl I No. 70/2003 as amended; Art. 5 para. 1 lit. e, Art. 17, Art. 58 para. 2 lit. and Article 77 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR), OJ No. L 119 p. 1. EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM A. Arguments of the parties and procedure 1. In his complaint of 8 June 2018, the complainant alleged an infringement of the right to erasure and essentially argued that he had concluded a mobile telephony contract with the Respondent. According to his understanding of the law, according to § 99 TKG 2003 traffic data should be saved for a maximum of three months or would have to be anonymised. He submitted an application for cancellation to the Respondent on 5.6.2018. Specifically, it concerns the deletion of the traffic data concerning the invoice numbers 6147068962, 6148927261 and 9327594470. This request for deletion or anonymization had rejected the Respondent. 2. By letter dated 12.6.2018, GZ DSB-D122.995 / 0001-DSB / 2018, the Respondent was invited to comment on the complaint lodged against her. 3. By observations of 29.6.2018, the Respondent submitted that it processes data in the sense of §§ 92 ff TKG 2003. In traffic data processing, a distinction is made on the one hand between traffic data processing for billing purposes and on the other traffic data processing for operational purposes. Regarding traffic data processing for billing purposes, § 99 (2) TKG 2003 regulates those cases when traffic data can not be deleted. In addition to traffic data processing for billing purposes, the processing of traffic data is essential for a mobile communications company in order to be able to ensure the operation of the network and thus the fulfillment of the service contracts with end customers. The TKG 2003 does not contain any rules regarding concrete storage periods with regard to operational purposes. Rather, each operator sets these deadlines in accordance with the general data protection regulations. These operational purposes are essential for the maintenance and operation of a functioning network. Reference is made to § 99 (3) TKG 2003. The Respondent has defined and documented the retention periods in various internal company directories. This is based on Art. 30 DSGVO. Specifically, the traffic data would be stored for billing purposes six months. This duration can be justified several times. First, it is related to the settlement of end customer contracts. These are usually billed to end users on a monthly basis, so that, given the eight billing cycles that the Respondent uses, a date can be up to four weeks old before it is printed on an invoice. Taking account of the mail flow for the transmission to the end customer as well as for an objection and the three-month objection period pursuant to Section 71 (1) TKG 2003, this would amount to a storage period of approx. 5 ½ months. In addition, services from roaming partners would usually not be done so quickly, so traffic data exchanged shifted and therefore would be charged later. Intercompany interconnection services could be charged up to three years later. For this purpose, this traffic data is also required. With regard to the conciliation procedure with the regulatory authority pursuant to Section 71 (2) et seq. TKG 2003, it could happen that a complaint relates to an invoice whose connection data date back more than three months. Furthermore, according to § 6 AStG, a final customer has the possibility to initiate a conciliation procedure within one year, so that the traffic data would have to be kept even for one year. The retention period of six months is also required with regard to the RoamingIV Safeguard Monitoring (Implementation Regulation of the EU Commission 2016/2286). Here, the roaming surcharge after the sixth bill, in fact only after about seven calendar months, charged. In the event of an objection, the reason for the roaming surcharges must be reproducible. In addition, the Respondent argued that the Appellant had sought waiver of the statutory right to the bill in the run-up to the complaint. However, that is not possible in view of the fact that this can not be done unilaterally and that, in any event, the agreement of the other contractor - the Respondent - is required. 4. By letter from the Data Protection Authority dated 18.7.2018, GZ DSB-D122.995 / 0002-DSB / 2018, the complainant's opinion was sent to the respondent within the framework of the party hearing. 5. By observations of 23.7.2018, the appellant essentially argued that the use of traffic data was possible after expiry of the three-month time limit pursuant to § 99 (2) TKG 2003, provided anonymisation took place. A personal reference is only necessary with regard to the final account settlement. Since he did not reside abroad during the relevant period of the complaint, the respondent's reasoning concerning the RoamingIV Safeguard Monitoring was not relevant. His mobile contract with the Respondent was terminated on 1.6.2018. He continues to request the cancellation or anonymisation of all traffic data relating to invoices sent to him more than three months ago. B. Object of the complaint In the present case, the question arises as to whether the appellant was infringed in his right to cancellation because the Respondent did not delete or anonymise the traffic data concerning him after the period of three months set out in section 99 (2) TKG 2003 , C. Determination of facts The Respondent operates a telecommunications service and has concluded a mobile phone contract with the complainant, which ended on 1.6.2018. There is no exemption according to § 99 Abs. 2 Z 1 to 4 TKG 2003. The Respondent stores traffic data for a period of six months. On 5 June 2018, the complainant submitted to the Respondent an application for deletion of the traffic data relating to invoice numbers 6147068962, 6148927261 and 9327594470, the Respondent having rejected the application. The complainant seeks the cancellation or anonymisation of all traffic data relating to invoices delivered to him more than three months ago. Assessment of evidence: The findings are based on the submissions of the complainant and the respondent, which are undisputed. D. From a legal point of view: 1. The provision of § 99 TKG 2003 implements Article 6 of Directive 2002/58 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy electronic communications (e-privacy Directive) (see Feiel / Lehofer, Telekommunikationsgesetz 2003 [2004] 290). According to Article 6 (4) of the e-Privacy Directive, a distinction is made between the processing of traffic data for billing purposes (Article 6 (2) leg. Cit.) On the one hand and processing for the purpose of marketing electronic communications services or providing services with added value (Art 6 para. 3 leg. Cit.) On the other hand. Such a distinction can also be found in the definition of § 92 (3) (4) TKG 2003 (arg. "Or"). 2. Section 99 (2) TKG 2003 regulates the processing of traffic data for billing purposes. According to the wording of the law, the traffic data must be deleted or anonymised after a period of three months, unless there is one of the exceptions listed in paras 1 to 4. 3. The processing of traffic data for the purpose of marketing electronic communications services or providing services with added benefits (Article 6 (3) of the e-Privacy Directive) is regulated in Article 99 (3) TKG 2003, whereby Art. 6 para. 4 e-Privacy Directive (see Feiel / Lehofer, loc. Cit., 290). Pursuant to Section 99 (3) TKG 2003, the volume of traffic data processed must be limited to the absolutely necessary minimum. 4. As the Data Protection Authority has already stated in a similar appeal procedure, a retention period of three months, which is not specified in the Act, is not in accordance with Article 5 (1) lit. e DSGVO (see decision of the DPA of 28.5.2018, GZ DSB-D216.471 / 0001-DSB / 2018). According to this provision, personal data must be stored in a form which allows the identification of the data subject only for as long as it is necessary for the purposes for which they are developed ("memory limit"). 5. Therefore, in the case in question, the Respondent is only entitled to save traffic data for billing purposes in accordance with § 99 (2) TKG 2003 for a maximum period of three months or until the expiry of the periods specified in Sections 1 to 4 of this provision. 6. It is true that the Respondent understands that the TGK 2003 (and not also the e-Privacy Directive) standardizes an explicit deletion period for traffic data for the purpose of marketing electronic communications services or providing added-value services. In view of the fact that, in the present case, the contractual relationship between the parties to the proceedings ended indisputably on 1.6.2018, it is not clear why, at the time of the present decision (in December 2018), the processing of this traffic data is still required. 7. Since the deadline of three months has expired at the present time pursuant to § 99 (2) TKG 2003, no application of para 2 (1) to (4) leg. Cit. Consequently, if there is no justification for further storage of traffic data for other purposes, all traffic data concerning the complainant must be deleted or anonymized. 8. For the restoration of the data protection compliant state, the data protection authority was therefore in accordance with Art. 58 para. 2 lit. d DSGVO in conjunction with § 24 (5) of the DSG entitles the Respondent, within a set period of time, to instruct according to the terms of the law to produce the legally compliant condition. The appeal was therefore to be upheld in accordance with the rules.
