Obvious spelling, grammatical and punctuation errors have been corrected.] DECISION The DPA decides on the application of 6 December 2018 for a decision on the legality of the applicant's provision of information by the claimant A *** Collection and Credit Agency Gesellschaft mbH. to Paul H. E *** as follows: - The application is dismissed. Legal basis: § 24 (1) Data Protection Act - DSG BGBl. I No. 165/1999, as amended, Art. 51 (1) and Art. 77 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), OJ. No. L 119 of 4.5.2016 p. 1, § 1 General Administrative Procedures Act 1991 - AVG, BGBl. Nr. 51/1991 idgF; § 1 Information Duty Law - AuskPflG, BGBl. Nr. 287/1987 as amended. EXPLANATORY STATEMENT A. Arguments of the parties and procedural method By submission of 6 December 2018, the applicant requested that the Data Protection Authority be informed by decision as to whether its information to the data protection lawyer Paul H. E *** was in conformity with the law. B. From a legal point of view: The Data Protection Authority is the national supervisory authority pursuant to Art. 51 (1) GDPR. Their responsibilities are exhausted in their duties and powers conferred on them by Articles 57 and 58 DSGVO and §§ 20, 21, 32 and 33 DSG. The applicant seeks a co-ordination agreement as to whether the scope of the information given to the privacy advocate Paul H. E *** is "sufficient and correct from the point of view of the Authority" because the Applicant wishes to know this for the future. The question of whether a certain information meets the legal requirements, would be examined exclusively in the context of a complaint procedure under § 24 DSG. The applicant is not entitled to initiate such a data protection complaint procedure in the absence of a complaint authorization. Regardless of this, according to the settled case - law of the Administrative Court, in principle it is not permissible to make statements on applications that are so abstract that they approximate a legal opinion, with the reason for the associated danger of self - binding authority (cf Mar. 18, 1997, Zl. 95/08/0014, VwSlg. 14636 A / 1997). The claim had to be dismissed in accordance with the rules.
